Watch: New Zealand earthquakes caught on video 00:42 Story highlights Two people have died in series of earthquakes Small tsunami hits country's eastern coast, although warning has since been lifted (CNN)A series of powerful earthquakes jolted New Zealand's South Island Monday, triggering a tsunami and sending aftershocks across the country that left at least two dead, officials said. The first event, a 7.8-magnitude quake, struck just after midnight Monday near the coastal community of Kaikoura, some 93 kilometers (55 miles) northeast of the city of Christchurch, the US Geological Survey reported. It triggered waves of 2.49 meters (8 feet) above usual tide levels, the highest he has seen in his 38 years in New Zealand, Philip Duncan of Weather Watch New Zealand said. A 6.2-magnitude quake struck around 1:30 p.m. 39 kilometers west-southwest of Kaikoura, further north of Christchurch. Prime Minister John Key posted a short video to YouTube after surveying the damage. Fissures run along a road by the Centre Port in Wellington, Monday, November 14 after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck New Zealand's south Island early in the morning. Aftershocks At least 42 seismic events have been recorded in the area in the last day, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). id)); Last 48 hours in NZ in 30 seconds. Aftershocks from South Island reverberated all the way to Wellington, the country's capital on the North Island, where residents were told to stay indoors Monday.

The South Island has been hit by a flurry of aftershocks, according to the USGS and New Zealand's Geonet service, some with a magnitude above 6.0. Officials from the island's second-largest town, Dunedin, called a state of emergency there. Life in a 'collision zone' Residents around the epicenter reported shaking for minutes that sent grocery items flying from shelves. The USGS initially reported the quake's magnitude at 7.4 at a depth of just 10 kilometers -- shallow enough to cause serious destruction to the immediate surrounding area. It later revised the quake strength to 7.8, but changed its depth to 23 kilometers (14.2 miles), giving more of a buffer between the epicenter and the Earth's surface. id)); The first wave may not be the largest.

Both caused widespread property damage. Six and seven years later, there are many thousands of unresolved property claims. The judgment is of note because it followed an earlier refusal by the same court to give the group leave to proceed. The second hearing was also a finely balanced matter. The insurer has filed an appeal. When this earthquake-related class action is compared with securities or product liability class actions or the recent bank fees action in New Zealand and Australia, the obvious difficulty for the claimants is that their houses will be different, the physical damage will be different and their resulting claims will be different. However, this may not be a bar to a successful class action if the cause of the alleged loss can be imputed to the defendant treating each claim under the same policy in a similar and identifiable way. The case offers the opportunity to compare the unsuccessful and successful applications and briefly survey the landscape of such actions. Class actions in New Zealand There is no class action legislation in New Zealand. A bill is in the pipeline, but has been languishing there since the draft Class Actions Bill and Rules was sent for consultation in 2008. It is not because the courts have set the threshold of what constitutes a common interest or claim particularly high. Leave is not mandatory, but in reality most defendants seek a declaration that the case not proceed as a class action. The courts have overlaid non-onerous strictures onto Rule 4.24 that no defendant be deprived of a defence that would have been available to defend a claim brought by an individual and no one within a class should be able to succeed if he or she would not have been able to bring an individual claim. Notably, by the time of the second hearing, Southern Response submitted that it was no longer using bulk costings and was using market rates. In deciding that the threshold of common interest had not been reached, Mander expressly left the door open for a second chance by declining leave to proceed without prejudice to the group filing an amended statement of claim. Second High Court decision Although more detail was provided in the amended statement of claim, there was not a wholesale change to the way that the claim was pleaded. It remains to be seen how those individual claims would be managed. Funding and expansion of claim At the time of the first High Court judgment, there were 46 claimants. By the time of the second judgment, the number was 41 and the original named representatives (Prestons) were among those who had settled since the first judgment. The class now numbers 36. However, the group was given opt-in time to advertise and try to bring in more policyholders. A three-month opt-in date was directed from the time that the solicitors for the plaintiff group can communicate with the unresolved Southern response claimants. The litigation funding agreement can be enquired into by a court in every case where leave for a representative action is sought. Comment Southern Response was established for the sole purpose of settling claims of domestic policyholders after the insurer AMI could not meet its liabilities. The government ownership is perhaps less relevant to the observer than the notion that such run-off claim entities may have a different incentive than ongoing concerns, in that renewing, increasing or attracting customers is not on the agenda. This was part of the group plaintiff's submission at the second hearing. After the first ruling, insurance law expert Rob Merkin told Insurance Business that he would have been amazed if the court had found that there was a basis for a representative action. It remains to be seen whether the Court of Appeal is similarly concerned and whether any success will encourage other class actions either arising from Christchurch or from the recent earthquake affecting both the small town of Kaikoura and the capital city, Wellington.

The first call I made did not go through. I suspect some trouble on the lines. Our best wishes to everyone affected by this set of earthquakes. Mohandas Gandhi Be the light that is within. We now tall over 15,027 quakes since Sept. 2010 and these are some of the worst as the damage is much more widespread. The North and East Coast of the South Island are shaking still and there are damages to roads around the capitol city Wellington and Marlborough Sounds have land slippage of 3 to 4 meters on the road from Kaikoura northwards. Mohandas Gandhi Be the light that is within. Thousands on the country's east coast have fled after a warning to move to higher ground. The Civil Defence Ministry said people close to the epicentre could see waves three to five metres high after the quake, measured at 7.5 in magnitude. Waves of up to between 1.5 and two metres have already hit the Kaikoura area, according to New Zealand's Geonet group. At least one tunnel is collapsed. Picton is the main passenger and freight port for the Southern Island. Mohandas Gandhi Be the light that is within. Bless you Sally and Graham and Sharon and Shiloh. Mohandas Gandhi Be the light that is within. People are asked to follow the advice of local Civil Defence groups and stay informed through media and social media reports. The quakes triggered a tsunami warning which has now been cancelled. There is no longer any tsunami threat to any area of NZ. However coastal areas may have unusually strong coastal currents or sea level fluctuations for some time and we continue to advise people to take extra care around the water. New Zealanders are shaken but are coming together and supporting each other. Expect aftershocks and remember to drop, cover and hold. Look after yourself and get first aid if necessary. Help others if you can. Building assessments should be done before buildings are opened for normal use, particularly in areas which experienced strong shaking such as the CBD areas of Wellington, Christchurch and Blenheim. Watch out for fallen power lines or broken gas lines. Stay out of damaged areas. Listen to the radio for updated emergency information and instructions. Do not overload phone lines with non-emergency calls. Text friends and family to see if they are OK. We have new information about the fault ruptures, and have initial estimates on which faults were involved. Multiple ruptures Rapid field reconnaissance indicates that multiple faults have ruptured: Kekerengu Fault at the coast - appears to have had up to 10m of slip Newly identified fault at Waipapa Bay Hope Fault - seaward segment - minor movement Hundalee Fault In the simplest case an earthquake is a rupture on a single fault plane. What we are finding in New Zealand is that quite a few of our larger earthquakes involve jumping from rupture on one plane to another in a complex sequence. We first saw that with the Darfield Sept 2010 EQ where multiple segments ruptured together as a single earthquake. We appear to have seen this again overnight. In terms of what might happen next: The scenarios provide an overview of how we see this earthquake sequence evolving over the next few days to one month. What is on the web page is our best information that we have to hand at the moment. As our science information flows in over the next few days we expect that information may evolve. ShakeMap for the M7.5 Kaikoura Earthquake. A word about the Moon Some people have raised concerns about a link with the supermoon. In large groups earthquakes exhibit slight associations with lunar cycles, but this is not reliable for forecasting. We have two tides a day throughout New Zealand and at any one place there is no clear association in location. The occurrence of the full moon around the globe does not allow us to say how big, when and where any earthquake might be. Long term earthquake rates There were more large earthquakes in a period of several decades prior to about 1950, and it has been relatively quiet since then. Since the M7.8 in July 2009 in Fiordland, that quiet period appears to be over. The reason we had a tsunami generated by an earthquake with an epicentre onshore is that there was deformation further down the fault plane offshore. Wellington area Wellington area faults and the subduction interface beneath Wellington are captured in the probability table and the scenarios given there. We do not have any evidence of an impending large earthquake of a similar size in Wellington at this stage but we cannot rule this out. We cannot make a calculation to predict this, but the chance of a further shock in the Wellington area has increased somewhat since the Kaikoura earthquake. Why were our magnitudes different from the USGS: About magnitude variability We have currently established that the New Zealand local magnitude for this earthquake is 7.5, but this may be reviewed over time when more detailed research is undertaken. This may bring it closer to the internationally-derived value (e.g. Mw7.8 by the US Geological Survey). Tell us about it. Our Felt Detailed report for this earthquake is now available. Please help us by filling out this report to help our long term research programme. Looking forward We will be continuing to gather information about this earthquake for some time.

Ministry of Justice members of the Public Service Association will strike from 10.30am to 12.30pm today. PSA National Secretary Glenn Barclay said on Monday that eleventh hour meetings were held between the PSA Bargaining Team and Ministry of Justice to reach a resolution but no movement on fundamental pay issues was offered. He said the union is seeking an outcome that ensures members including court security officers, registry officers, victim advisors, court reporters and Family Court coordinators are reasonably paid. He said the ministry offered the third lowest average salary in the public sector last year and the PSA believes this is being worsened. Kaitaia District Court.

Sir Ray complained to Netsafe under the Harmful Digital Communications Act, regarding five articles Newsroom had published about fundraising he was doing for his LifePod inventions, and about his other past products. He said the articles caused him severe emotional distress and amounted to harassment and digital harm under the Act. Newsroom has refused to take the articles down. Netsafe Director Martin Cocker said there isn't anything more Netsafe can do through mediation. That mediation process is a mandatory first step under the Act, and most Harmful Digital Communications Act complaints are sorted at this point. However Mr Cocker said the main thing they do to get resolution, is to advise parties on what the likely legal ramifications are of different actions that they might take. In this case, Mr Cocker said, there is not clarity in the Act about how these particular cases should be handled. Mr Cocker said if they did not feel they could progress the case, their advice was to consider taking it to the district court. Sir Ray Avery. Source: 1 NEWS Topics New Zealand Internet What to do and what not to do if you come across a kiwi in the wild 1 NEWS SHARE SHARE Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Topics New Zealand Animals Conservation A rare daytime encounter with a kiwi on the Heaphy Track got TVNZ1's Seven Sharp thinking - what to do and what not to do when you come across the native bird in the wild. The Department of Conservation (DOC) says it's pretty unusual for these nocturnal birds to be out during sunshine hours. As we all know kiwi don't fly so escaping predators can be pretty tricky. An average of 27 are killed every week, so we've got to be pretty careful around them. DOC gave Seven Sharp some important tips to remember if you encounter one of these unique birds. Firstly stay still and just enjoy the rare experience. Stay a few metres away and don't worry if they approach you, just keep still. Second, don't move towards the bird or try to pick it up - it's an offence to hold kiwi without permission from DOC. Also, be weary of their sharp claws - they're wild animals and can get stroppy. Lastly, feel free to take photos or video, but only in low light conditions and don't use a flash as it can stun the birds."}

The magnitude 7.8 quake that struck the South Island early Monday left two people dead and triggered a small tsunami. It also brought down rocks and mud that swept across highways and cracked apart roads. Dust created by a strong aftershock hangs above the Clarence River which was blocked following an earthquake north of Kaikoura, New Zealand, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016. But the quake knocked out water supplies and sewer systems and left people with no easy way out. Webb said the military was using four NH90 helicopters that could each transport about 18 people at a time out of the town. He said the ship could pick up hundreds of people if weather conditions allowed. He said the operation could take several days and that if needed, a C-130 military transport plane could drop fuel, water, food and other supplies to the town. He said about five metric tons of supplies were ready to be delivered from Christchurch. Sarah Stuart-Black, director of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, said the priority was transporting out those people with health issues or international flights booked. She said 34 people had been airlifted out by noon Tuesday. She said the community was rallying to help the tourists. Elsewhere, many people returned to work in the capital, Wellington, after the quake shut down much of the central city on Monday. But some buildings remained closed and heavy rain and flooding compounded the difficulties for others. And strong aftershocks continued to shake New Zealand, rattling the nerves of exhausted residents. Police said one person died in Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Several other people suffered minor injuries in Kaikoura, police spokeswoman Rachel Purdom said. Prime Minister John Key flew over Kaikoura by helicopter Monday as aftershocks kicked up dust from the landslides below. Cars could be seen lying on their sides and parts of the road were clearly impassable. Police stepped up their patrols after receiving several reports of burglaries in homes and businesses that had been evacuated due to the quake. Police said six guns, some of them antiques, were stolen from a home near the town of Nelson. Three cows whose predicament captured the interest of people around the world after they became stranded on a small island of grass in an area ripped apart by the quake were rescued. The Newshub news service reported a farmer and some helpers dug a track to them and brought them out.

Before You Travel Sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). Pack some extra cash and carry it with you. Check the weather forecast. During an Earthquake Remember these three words: drop, cover and hold. Drop to your hands and knees to prevent injuries from falls when shaking makes standing difficult. Hold that position until the shaking stops. Contrary to popular belief, doorways are NOT good places to stand in during an earthquake. After the Shaking Stops Inspect your surroundings for any structural damage. If something looks unsafe, get out. Always follow instructions from local officials, even if you think they are being overly cautious. Realize that police and other emergency services may have shifted priorities in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, so getting ahold of someone for unrelated help may take some time. Be aware that tsunamis may occur in coastal areas, even if the shaking was only minor. The best beginner points and miles card out there.

Full US Geological Survey map Credit: EPA Scientists are investigating the possibility that the seismic event may have been two earthquakes, according to news website stuff.co.nz. The complexity made it hard to estimate how deep the quake was, and to identify whether there was any tsunami risk scientists said. There is a tsunami threat is to areas marked in green on the map. The response by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM), which took 40 minutes to send the first national advisory after the quake hit and a further 20 minutes to issue a tsunami alert, will be reviewed said the New Zealand Herald. The first tsunami activity has arrived. A wave height measuring 30cm was measured at East Cape a short time ago. The tsunami warning was later lifted. The warning covered the East Coast of the North Island and the upper South Island. It was centred 167 kilometres (103 miles) from the nearest main town, Gisborne, which has a population of around 45,000. The shallow tremor was estimated at a depth of around 30 kilometres (18 miles) off the coast, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). We're getting lots of aftershocks this morning. Remember to Drop, Cover & Hold. It was not apparent until sea level measurements started coming in that something needed to be done. Earthquakes in that area are not uncommon as it's one f the most seismically active areas in New Zealand, GNS seismologist John Ristau told the New Zealand Herald.

Here, the oceanic Hikurangi Plateau is sinking beneath the continental crust of the Indo-Australian plate. The line to the left of the Hikurangi Plateau is the subduction zone in question. Initially, most suspected the southern end was pretty rigidly stuck, but the quake changed all that. When it ruptures, it could produce a powerful, potentially record-breaking megathrust earthquake.

Local broadcaster TVNZ aired footage showing a damaged store in Wellington, around 440 km from Christchurch. Cracks have appeared in roads around Centre Port, Wellington, after an earthquake based around Cheviot in the South Island shook the New Zealand capital. Emergency response teams were dispatched by helicopter to the region at the epicentre of the 7.8 magnitude quake, that struck at midnight on Monday (11am Irish time), 91km (57 miles) north-northeast of Christchurch in the South Island, amid reports of injuries and collapsed buildings. Prime minister John Key told a dawn news conference in the capital Wellington, where the quake was also felt strongly, that two people had been killed. Police said one of the victims was found in a house in the coastal tourist town of Kaikoura. Emergency officials were meeting later on Monday morning, added Mr Key. Power was out and phone lines down in many areas of the country, while roads were blocked by landslips. Rescue personnel St John Ambulance said it was sending helicopters carrying medical and rescue personnel to Kaikoura, where at least one of the casualties was located. The South Island town, a popular destination for whale watching, was completely cut off and officials said there were reports of a collapsed building. Richard Maclean, a spokesman for Wellington City Council, said there was structural damage to several buildings. Residents were advised to stay away from the central business district on Monday and the train network was closed for checks. Wellington International airport, however, was expected to open as usual on Monday. In Christchurch, where tsunami sirens continued intermittently, three evacuation centres were accepting residents. Police set up roadblocks to prevent people from returning to lower-lying coastal areas. Pictures shared on social media showed buckled roads, smashed glass and goods toppled from shelves in shops in Wellington and the upper South Island. There was initial confusion when emergency services first said there was no tsunami threat. Christchurch Civil Defence Controller John Mackie said that while the earthquake was centred inland, the fault line extended offshore for a considerable distance. That meant that seismic activity could cause movement out at sea, leading to a tsunami. Sign In Invalid email or password."}

At a press conference yesterday, Mr Mallard said he had received expert advice the birds had been bludgeoned to death. But, anti-1080 protester, Alan Gurden, said that statement was ridiculous and said he would be suing for slander. Mr Gurden said there was no way the birds had been bludgeoned. Some of the birds were roadkill, while others were picked up from a 1080 dropzone in 2014, Mr Gurden said. However, he could not say for sure if they died as a result of 1080. In a written statement today, after being advised by RNZ of Mr Gurden's defamation threat, Mr Mallard said he was not going to be bullied but would make no further comment.

Fletcher's prefabricated method means it takes around one to four days to weatherproof a home compared to 50 days for a standard built duplex home. The trial is a proof of concept for the construction giant's factory which will open next year, producing around 500 prefabricated houses annually. Once the basic modules are up, the homes can be finished off in six weeks, that's so all the interiors and exterior claddings can be personalised, said the company. For now the cost of construction is about the same as conventional homes. We're struggling to do that. with panelisation, we can do it quicker. The company plans to set up a factory in South Auckland, the first panels coming off the line by mid next year. The aim is to build around 500 homes a year, with the KiwiBuild market in mind. The festival decided to ban moko last year, following complaints about incorrect use.

If we look at the data of past 15 years, this year the rains are really satisfactory. In the past, Cauvery dams used to get filled only at August-end but now breaking it by getting filled in mid-July. Rains in Wayanad in Kerala, one of the main catchment areas of Cauvery which was not satisfactory for the past few years, is doing very well, Srinivas said. Going by the rain forecast for the next week, we are sure that it will continue in the Cauvery catchment area and fill the remaining KRS and Hemavathy in a matter of another five days, he said. Unlike last year, the monsoon was active right from May and the inflow to the dams were generated early. Last year, till June, the inflow was not generated. While the level of KRS is at 115.20 feet now, last year at the same time it was 78.70 feet, Srinivas pointed out. He went on to say that going by the hydrological conditions, there shall not be any problem in the supply of Cauvery water to Bengaluru and sharing the same with Tamil Nadu. Rainfall was intense in the catchment area of the Cauvery and Kabini and Kodagu district received 87.30 mm of rainfall for the 24 hour period ending 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday. mm received during the corresponding period last year. The Kodagu district administration had declared a holiday for schools and colleges on Wednesday in view of the relentless downpour since Tuesday. According to the Karnataka State Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), Mysuru district has received 195.4 mm of rainfall from June 1 while the district average for the 24 hour period ending 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday, was 11 mm. In the adjoining Kodagu district, Bhagamandala received 175.04 mm for the same period while Srimangala received 109.40 mm, Napoklu 101.20 mm, and Shanthahalli 185.20 mm of rainfall. As a result the inflow to Harangi reservoir has increased to 14,973 cusecs and the outflow from the dam was at the rate of 11,938 cusecs. The reservoir level was hovering at 2,857.45 feet against the FRL of 2,859 feet. Increase in nflow Heavy to very heavy rains in Mananthavady, which is the catchment area for the Kabini, also led to an increase in the inflow into the reservoir at H.D.Kote in Mysuru district. The rate of inflow was 49,800 cusecs at 6.30 a.m. on Wednesday and as the dam was almost full, the outflow was stepped up to 50,000 cusecs to maintain the reservoir levels. Caution The water level in the dam was hovering at 2,282.22 feet against the full reservoir level of 2,284 feet. With more rains expected in adjoining Kerala, the authorities expect the outflow from the dam to be increased further and have cautioned people living in the downstream to move to safer places. Consequent to the heavy discharge, low-lying areas along the banks of the river in the downstream suffered partial inundation. The river was in spate at Nanjangud where the bathing ghats were flooded and the Hadinaru Kalu Mantapa was submerged. Similarly, the Chikkamma Chikkadevi temple was inundated while the water level was almost touching the Hejjige bridge across the Kabini which connects the temple town to 16 villages in the vicinity. Temples out of bounds Many temples on the river banks which are frequented by the pilgrims were out of bounds as the temples were partially submerged and yet there were cases of priests wading in the water to perform the daily rituals before rushing back to safety. The water level at the Chikkaianachatra and Mallanamoole Mutt too had inundated the bathing ghats, but pilgrims went about taking a dip in the swollen river.

The investigation today forced the Government to act, opening an inquiry into its insurance company, Southern Response. It's not known how many people were spied on, but hundreds of people were involved in protests following the Christchurch quakes. Cam Preston. Photo credit: Newshub. Thompson and Clark's security risk management proposal. Photo credit: Newshub. Translation: Thompson and Clark is fishing for information. Mr Preston puts it in even simpler terms. Mr Preston had certainly been persistent, sending emails almost daily - hundreds in total. He was protesting, fighting to get his claim settled. Once, he shouted at the Southern Response chief executive. He was also helping organise a group of claimants taking a legal case against Southern Response. The exact spying tactics used by Thompson and Clark have been kept secret, but the organisation has previously been caught snooping on and even infiltrating environmental groups. The spying came as a shock to Mr Preston's wife, Wendy. I mean, it seems silly to even say it. I don't know. The Preston family in their garden. Photo credit: Newshub. An email from Thompson and Clark to Southern Response, obtained by Mr Preston under the Official Information Act, shows the private investigators keen to get police involved. An email obtained under the Official Information Act. Photo credit: Newshub. The name was obviously Cam Preston, because a week later, police hit him up. A police report shows Southern Response told police Mr Preston was a risk to several staff. That's a reference to the attack in which two Work and Income staff members were shot dead. It's just.. no, you can't do that to normal people. Ms Preston said. It's just not the Kiwi way. It's not how we do things in New Zealand, and that's probably the reason I'm talking to you now. They are ordinary Kiwis subjected to extraordinary spying. Following inquiries from Newshub, the State Services Commissioner announced an official inquiry will be launched. SSC Peter Hughes says the evidence raises questions around compliance and with standards of integrity and conduct for state servants. Newshub."}

There were no tsunami warnings issued immediately after the quake. At least 248 people have now been confirmed dead after huge earthquake struck Mexico City just hours before and a strong earthquake hit Japan in the same 24 hour time frame. The quake was felt strongly in the capital New Zealand Wellington but no significant damage to buildings has been reported so far. Train services and traffic were disrupted in the area for structural engineering checks. Two smaller quakes a 4.7 and 5.0 magnitude were also recorded off the New Zealand coast. These according to the USGS do not classify as major earthquakes. New Zealand is prone to earthquakes as the country is situated on the boundary of two major tectonic plates, the Pacific and Australasian plates. The news comes just hours after a powerful 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico City, toppling dozens of buildings and killing hundreds of people. The quake hit while people were taking part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a major earthquake killed thousands in the city. Mexico has been praised by the international community for the rapid and humanitarian response to the earthquake disaster. Thousands of Mexican severely and rushed to the aid of those trapped, lost or in need.

Yesterday morning's giant quake was centred near the popular North Canterbury town. It's accessed only by the old wooden Waiau Ferry Bridge, which was closed after the shaking out of caution. Slips and rockfall had also come down on the road. The bridge was cleared to let out some tourists and others for a few hours yesterday afternoon. Today it's opened up traffic to light vehicles under 10-tonne. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The town is also deserted. The popular thermal hot pools is closed.

International warships bound for New Zealand to celebrate the country's naval history this week have been drafted to help earthquake relief efforts. Naval ships from the United States, Canada and Australia were bound for Auckland - the northern part of New Zealand's north island to celebrate the 75th anniversary of New Zealand's navy - but they have been diverted to the south island, parts of which have been devastated by a quake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale. The resort town of Kaikura bore the brunt of the seismic shock. On Tuesday, New Zealand military helicopters began airlifting 1,200 holiday makers trapped in the seaside town - and more help is on the way. Watch video 01:03 Now live 01:03 mins. After the quake in New Zealand The navy ship HMNZS Canterbury is expected to arrive later Wednesday and Brownlee said he was also sending three other New Zealand vessels. He said the international vessels already on site were Canada's HMC Vancouver, Australia's HMAS Darwin and the US destroyer USS Sampson. Nuclear free zone The Sampson is the first US warship to visit New Zealand in 33 years. For decades the Wellington government barred US military vessels from its ports because they are powered by nuclear energy. New Zealand declared itself a nuclear free zone in the early 1980s. The stand-off was finally resolved last July. Massive landslides have blocked roads and rail lines, in some cases cutting off entire communities. Prime Minister John Key said rescuers are delivering much-needed supplies to the hardest-hit areas before starting a clean-up that is likely to cost billions of dollars. But in the chaos that followed the quake he missed a call from US President-elect Donald Trump.

The quake hit just after midnight on Monday (11:02 GMT on Sunday), north-east of Christchurch. It was felt as far afield as the capital Wellington on the North Island, 120 miles (200km) away. A tsunami arrived about two hours later. Officials warned everyone along the eastern coast to head inland or for higher ground. Police said one person died in the town of Kaikoura on the eastern coast, which has been cut off by road and where electric power is out and phones are down. It is not yet clear how they were killed. Tsunami waves A gauge at Kaikoura, 181 km (112 miles) north of Christchurch, measured a wave of 2.5m (8ft 2ins) in the early hours of the morning, according to Weatherwatch.co.nz. At one point, the ministry of civil defence suggested tsunami waves as tall as five metres could hit the eastern coast. Aftershocks continued throughout Monday morning.

Very sorry that NZ is having to go through all this upheaval again. In large groups earthquakes exhibit slight associations with lunar cycles, but this is not reliable for forecasting. We have two tides a day throughout New Zealand and at any one place there is no clear association in location.

Over 130 people have now been evacuated from Kaikoura, with rescue efforts continuing. Severe weather in Wellington aside, Stuart-Black said: The rest of New Zealand is still operating as usual.

She did not have specific details on the city centre building currently thought to be at risk of collapse in Wellington. Molesworth Street has been closed, and nearby buildings evacuated. Engineers are currently assessing the building. A statement on its website said: Following a detailed engineering assessment, Westpac stadium has been cleared of major structural damage.

I woke up at midnight local time last night as I felt a slight tremor. By the time I woke Ben up, the room was really beginning to shake. He went to the window to look outside and as soon as he crossed the room the full brunt of the earthquake hit and he was thrown across the room. The noise from the earthquake was indescribable, it was incredibly loud, at the same time we could also see bright white flashes outside from power lines being ripped apart. It lasted 30 seconds but it felt a lot longer. We ran down the emergency exit and it felt like something out of a movie: ceilings were falling down, cracks were rapidly appearing in the walls and the water pipes had burst so water was pouring down from the ceilings and flooding the corridors. The hotel staff were brilliant and we all sat outside waiting for the all-clear. Once outside, the tsunami siren starting ringing. A lot of people fled to Mount Victoria but this caused gridlock on the roads. We were given the all-clear to go back into the building at 3am, thinking we would be relatively safe on the seventh floor if a tsunami was to hit. Since then, we have felt eight major aftershocks, all ranging from about 5.7- 6.6. The hotel shakes and sways and the CBD in Wellington looks like a ghost town. We were having dinner when a 6.5 hit at 8.15pm local time. Seeing the restaurant and the high street outside swaying is something I will never forget. The front of the car park has collapsed. We were meant to be going over to Picton today but the ferries have stopped as the ports have sustained major damage. The most amazing thing is that for such a powerful earthquake, the damage caused is very minimal compared to the Christchurch earthquake 2011. We woke up expecting devastation.

Cool. Cool. Mild. Town Sunny. Cool. The defence force said it had started ferrying people out by military helicopter and that a navy ship from Auckland was due to arrive in the area on Wednesday morning. The magnitude 7.8 quake that struck the South Island early on Monday left two people dead and triggered a small tsunami. It also brought down rocks and mud that swept across highways and cracked apart roads. Home to about 2 000 residents, Kaikoura is a popular destination for travellers taking part in whale-watching expeditions or wanting a stopover with mountain views. But the quake knocked out water supplies and sewer systems and left people with no easy way out. Residents exhausted as aftershocks continue Webb said the military was using four NH90 helicopters that could each transport about 18 people at a time out of the town. He said the ship could pick up hundreds of people if weather conditions allowed. He said the operation could take several days and that if needed, a C-130 military transport plane could drop fuel, water, food and other supplies to the town. He said about five metric tons of supplies were ready to be delivered from Christchurch. Sarah Stuart-Black, director of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, said the priority was transporting out those people with health issues or international flights booked. She said 34 people had been airlifted out by noon on Tuesday. She said the community was rallying to help the tourists. Elsewhere, many people returned to work in the capital, Wellington, after the quake shut down much of the central city on Monday. But some buildings remained closed and heavy rain and flooding compounded the difficulties for others. And strong aftershocks continued to shake New Zealand, rattling the nerves of exhausted residents. Police said one person died in Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Several other people suffered minor injuries in Kaikoura, police spokeswoman Rachel Purdom said. Prime Minister John Key flew over Kaikoura by helicopter Monday as aftershocks kicked up dust from the landslides below. Cars could be seen lying on their sides and parts of the road were clearly impassable. Police stepped up their patrols after receiving several reports of burglaries in homes and businesses that had been evacuated due to the quake. Police said six guns, some of them antiques, were stolen from a home near the town of Nelson. Three cows whose predicament captured the interest of people around the world after they became stranded on a small island of grass in an area ripped apart by the quake were rescued.

Local broadcaster TVNZ aired footage showing a damaged store in Wellington, around 440 km from Christchurch. Cracks have appeared in roads around Centre Port, Wellington, after an earthquake based around Cheviot in the South Island shook the New Zealand capital. Emergency response teams were dispatched by helicopter to the region at the epicentre of the 7.8 magnitude quake, that struck at midnight on Monday (11am Irish time), 91km (57 miles) north-northeast of Christchurch in the South Island, amid reports of injuries and collapsed buildings. Prime minister John Key told a dawn news conference in the capital Wellington, where the quake was also felt strongly, that two people had been killed. Police said one of the victims was found in a house in the coastal tourist town of Kaikoura. Emergency officials were meeting later on Monday morning, added Mr Key. Power was out and phone lines down in many areas of the country, while roads were blocked by landslips. Rescue personnel St John Ambulance said it was sending helicopters carrying medical and rescue personnel to Kaikoura, where at least one of the casualties was located. The South Island town, a popular destination for whale watching, was completely cut off and officials said there were reports of a collapsed building. Richard Maclean, a spokesman for Wellington City Council, said there was structural damage to several buildings. Residents were advised to stay away from the central business district on Monday and the train network was closed for checks. Wellington International airport, however, was expected to open as usual on Monday. In Christchurch, where tsunami sirens continued intermittently, three evacuation centres were accepting residents. Police set up roadblocks to prevent people from returning to lower-lying coastal areas. Pictures shared on social media showed buckled roads, smashed glass and goods toppled from shelves in shops in Wellington and the upper South Island. There was initial confusion when emergency services first said there was no tsunami threat. Christchurch Civil Defence Controller John Mackie said that while the earthquake was centred inland, the fault line extended offshore for a considerable distance. That meant that seismic activity could cause movement out at sea, leading to a tsunami. Sign In Invalid email or password."}

Very sorry that NZ is having to go through all this upheaval again. In large groups earthquakes exhibit slight associations with lunar cycles, but this is not reliable for forecasting.

The national relief effort is continuing, she said, targetting the worst affected areas: Food, water and fuel are required in Kaikoura, Hurunui and Marlborough. Over 130 people have now been evacuated from Kaikoura, with rescue efforts continuing. Severe weather in Wellington aside, Stuart-Black said: The rest of New Zealand is still operating as usual. However, she asked that New Zealanders (and visitors) respect local advice and prepare for aftershocks, adding: We urge caution about approaching buildings that have been damaged. She did not have specific details on the city centre building currently thought to be at risk of collapse in Wellington. Molesworth Street has been closed, and nearby buildings evacuated. Engineers are currently assessing the building. A statement on its website said: Following a detailed engineering assessment, Westpac stadium has been cleared of major structural damage. The stadium closed its doors yesterday as a precautionary measure following the Kaikoura 7.5 earthquake early on Monday morning. Stadium offices, and the ground level of the public car park, reopened on Tuesday. However the internal concourse and seating bowl remain closed until repairs have been completed. These repairs are expected to take two weeks to complete. The mezzanine level car park will remain closed until repairs are conducted on the car park up-ramp.

I woke up at midnight local time last night as I felt a slight tremor. By the time I woke Ben up, the room was really beginning to shake. He went to the window to look outside and as soon as he crossed the room the full brunt of the earthquake hit and he was thrown across the room. The noise from the earthquake was indescribable, it was incredibly loud, at the same time we could also see bright white flashes outside from power lines being ripped apart. It lasted 30 seconds but it felt a lot longer. We ran down the emergency exit and it felt like something out of a movie: ceilings were falling down, cracks were rapidly appearing in the walls and the water pipes had burst so water was pouring down from the ceilings and flooding the corridors. The hotel staff were brilliant and we all sat outside waiting for the all-clear. Once outside, the tsunami siren starting ringing. A lot of people fled to Mount Victoria but this caused gridlock on the roads. We were given the all-clear to go back into the building at 3am, thinking we would be relatively safe on the seventh floor if a tsunami was to hit. Since then, we have felt eight major aftershocks, all ranging from about 5.7- 6.6. The hotel shakes and sways and the CBD in Wellington looks like a ghost town. We were having dinner when a 6.5 hit at 8.15pm local time. Seeing the restaurant and the high street outside swaying is something I will never forget. The front of the car park has collapsed. We were meant to be going over to Picton today but the ferries have stopped as the ports have sustained major damage. The most amazing thing is that for such a powerful earthquake, the damage caused is very minimal compared to the Christchurch earthquake 2011. We woke up expecting devastation.

Only in recent years have seismologists taken reports of these so-called earthquake lights seriously. It turns out that researchers still don't fully understand the phenomenon, but they do have a few clues about where and why it occurs. Unexplained phenomenon Observers have documented shimmering earthquake lights more than 60 times over the past several centuries. In 2009, for instance, before a major earthquake struck L'Aquila, Italy, bystanders reported what looked like flames sizzling from the sidewalk, and in Canada's Yukon Territory in the 1970s, ghostly green orbs that were floating in the sky were initially thought to be UFOs but were later determined to be tied to a nearby quake. But until recently, many researchers discounted these reports as hearsay. But with the widespread availability of smartphones, these strange events are now being documented more frequently. In 2014, Freund and his colleagues showed that 97 percent of earthquake lights documented since the 1600s occurred at faults that were within continental plates, rather than at subduction zones, where one plate is diving beneath another. They found that 85 percent of the incidents occurred where Earth buckles and creates a steep ravine or drop in the Earth. This fissure allows magmatic rocks that originate deep belowground to gradually migrate up toward the surface, where they discharge energy. Because of how the atoms in these rocks are organized, they may generate an electrical charge more easily, flow upward to the surface, ionize the air and generate the light show, the researchers speculated. In this scenario, earthquake lights may not even be tied to earthquakes. Changes in stress at a fault can occur either due to a catastrophic rupture or because of a slower release over days, and both forms could generate an electrical charge that ionizes the air, according to the research. These mixtures were meant to mimic the way grains of Earth move in an earthquake zone. The researchers found that the mixtures reliably generated high voltages when tipped, even though they could not explain why. Original article on Live Science. All rights reserved.

The 7.8-magnitude quake, one of the most powerful ever recorded in New Zealand, hit just after midnight (1100 GMT Sunday) near the South Island town of Kaikoura, about 180 kilometres (110 miles) north of Christchurch. New Zealand pace bowler Matt Henry was asleep at home in Christchurch when the quake struck. The Pakistan touring squad felt the tremors in their hotel in Nelson, about 200 kilometres from the quake's centre. We were on the sixth and seventh floor, and evacuated immediately. The Pakistan women's team, who are also touring New Zealand, were on the 13th floor of a hotel in Christchurch when the tremors began. Basit Ali, their manager, told Pakistan's Geo News they were all safe. They are due to face the New Zealand women's team in the fourth one-day international at Nelson's Saxton Oval on Thursday.

The remainder of the east coast can expect waves of up to 1-3 metres. This means a threat to beach, harbour, estuary and small boat activities. The severity of currents and changing water flows will vary within a particular coastal area and over the period this warning is in effect. The initial, largest quake was magnitude 7.5 and 15km deep, according to monitor Geonet. Its epicentre was 15 km north-east of Culverden, close to Hanmer Springs, at 12.02am local time (New Zealand is 13 hours ahead of GMT). Tsunamis have been created by the quake, and people on the east coast of both South and North Islands have been told by civil defence and via emergency sirens to leave immediately for high ground. Evacuated hotel guests gather in a carpark in Wellington. Residents of both have been evacuated. There has been no official confirmation of casualties but St John ambulance services is deploying rescue helicopters to Kaikoura, along with additional paramedics. A large fissure runs along Kaikoura Road about two hours north of Christchurch. Power is out in many towns on the South Island east coast, including Picton, Blenheim and Kaikoura. The Chatham Islands, 680km southeast of NZ, is also on tsunami alert.

But my colleague Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from New Zealand that news is starting to circulate of possible injuries as a result of the quake. A building is reported to have collapsed in Kaikoura, with residents not yet accounted for. Reports are sketchy because telecommunications to the town are cut as a result of quake damage. There are also reports of major damage to roads and infrastructure in Kaikoura. St John ambulance services are reporting some injuries, and additional helicopters and paramedics have been called up. Stay off beaches. First waves have arrived but may not be the largest. November 13, 2016 It has warned that coastlines closest to the epicentre can expect waves up to 3-5m higher than normal. This covers Blenheim to the Banks peninsula, as well as the Chatham Islands, the dark blue areas shown on the map. It warns that the rest of the east coast can also expect increased waves of 1-3m higher than usual. People in all coastal areas are warned to stay away from beaches and out of the water. Morton made the immediate decision to evacuate his family to higher ground and packed the family in his truck and drove them to View Street, nearly 80m above sea level. After 40 minutes and no further serious activity, Morton and his family returned to their home. Just as he was getting into bed Morton noticed the tide was the lowest he had ever seen. People have brought their cats and dogs and are sharing food and drink. At the moment, most evacuees on View Street plan to remain there till dawn and then make a decision about returning to their homes.

Follow up on our article: National Solar Observatory, USPS office in Sunspot, NM evacuated and shutdown for 'safety reasons'. The National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico, and a nearby United States Postal Service office, were evacuated and shutdown for security reasons on September 9, 2018 observatory officials said but they refused to tell us the reason for the sudden shutdown. Then, NASA tries to explain what happened on September 9, 2018 by issuing a statement that there were two lunar transits passing in front of the sun. A transit happens when a celestial body passes between a larger body and an observer. The National Solar Observatory in New Mexico has been evacuated and locked down, the FBI is involved and they are not telling us the reason. The National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico, and a nearby United States Postal Service office, were evacuated for security reasons Thursday, observatory officials said. Friday, both properties remained closed to the public, with yellow caution tape around the property. Sunspot is located in the Sacramento Mountains in Otero County about 15 miles south of Cloudcroft. Even the local Sheriff, who was kept in the dark about the investigation throughout, was skeptical. Press release: On September 6th, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) made the decision to temporarily vacate the Sunspot Solar Observatory at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico as a precautionary measure while addressing a security issue. Mystery continues to surround the sudden shutdown last week of the national Sunspot Solar Observatory in New Mexico, and has remained closed since without explanation. Since authorities are tight-lipped, people are starting to carry out research on their own. One man has filmed the Solar Observatory with its drone, see video here, but another man has infiltrated the restricted area and has filmed it all. The video is outright eerie, but the most bizarre moment, albeit in a coincidental way, is when he spots an X-Files Unrestricted Access DVD laying out prominently in one of the buildings. The distance between the UFO disk and the base is just 6 km. Black square UFO appears from the clouds above Wisconsin On June 26, 2018 a photographer caught a black square UFO hanging in the sky below the clouds on June 26, 2018. The photographer says: I was riding in a car to go to the airport and flying back to Canada. The sky is still very dark when I left River Falls, Wisconsin. The sky was lightening on the middle of our trip and I took some photos of the thunder and lighting. I took a lot of images of the sky when the lighting flashed every 20 to 40 seconds. At the beginning, I didn't notice the object till I checked my iPhone camera in the car. It was the first photo that showed this object. I was so happy to be able to take a very special photo so I posted it on my Facebook right away when I landed in Toronto. Mufon report 94740. We have another set of mystery anomalies on MIMMIC Map. This time the patterns cross the entire Pacific Ocean. On top of the island is a drained lake with a diameter of 700 meters. The short video shows a flying saucer type object, most likely a lenticular cloud but left to the this UFO cloud there is another object partially cloaked that is sticking out of the cloud formation. Despite the photographer refers to the flying saucer like cloud it is the second partially cloaked object that makes it interesting, see above image. The photographer says: I was amazed by clouds during my way from home to work so I made many pictures and videos. But there was also UFO."}

However, the extent of the damage from the quake only really began to be realized as the morning dawned. Since the initial earthquake, around 2,100 aftershocks have occurred, with over 360 greater than magnitude 4 (the most powerful one reaching magnitude 6.3). Four faults have ruptured, according to Geonet, with one along the coast having reportedly slipped over 30 feet. While the center of the quake hit a less densely populated area (two fatalities have thus far been reported), the extent of the devastation throughout surrounding areas has been immense. According to the New Zealand Herald, the quake triggered approximately 100,000 landslides around the country. Roads and railway lines have been either damaged by the earthquake or entirely blocked off by the landslides. Kaikoura, the town closest to the epicenter, has been cut off from ground transportation, and was left with only three days of water supplies. Approximately 600 residents and 1,200 tourists have been trapped there. Warships from the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia are en route to assist New Zealand warships in providing aid to those stranded in the coastal town. Some roads leading into the town could be closed for weeks according to estimates. He canceled a trip to Argentina in order to remain in New Zealand and focus on the emergency at hand. The usually bustling capital city, Wellington (itself around 130 miles from the quake), was essentially shut down Monday as workers assessed the risks posed by damaged buildings. A large office block suffered critical structural damage and many fear it might collapse. Severe weather has been pounding the capital at the same time, including wind speeds of up to 80 miles per hour in parts of the wider Wellington area. Severe flooding and further slips have continued to affect the region, hampering cleanup. Since the quake, Wellington has been deluged by more rain within 24 hours than it usually receives during the entire month of November. And further inclement weather is forecast to continue later on in the week. After residents heeded tsunami warnings and fled their homes for the safety of higher ground, looters stepped in. At least 19 cases of looting have been reported. That quake directly affected a heavily urbanized area. It measured 6.3 on the Richter scale and devastated Christchurch, leaving 185 people dead. In the five years since that time, more than 10,000 smaller aftershocks and earthquakes have been registered in the vicinity. I visited Christchurch two weeks ago; residents there described for me the horror of the 2011 earthquake that is still fresh in their minds. Little did we realize what would take place again less than 60 miles northeast. Added to that, New Zealand was hit this September by a 7.1-magnitute earthquake, this one off the east cape of the North Island. While this quake was felt over much of the North Island and northern South Island, the epicenter was out at sea and damage was only superficial, resulting in no casualties. New Zealand lies directly over the boundary of what is known as the Ring of Fire, a highly geologically active ring encircling most of the Pacific Ocean. We New Zealanders are well familiar with regular tremors, but these recent massive earthquakes have been shocking and unusually destructive. It is heartbreaking to see your country experience such disasters. To be rendered powerless is scary. People caught in the middle of disasters need hope; they need answers. And despite what you may have previously heard from religions, these answers are available. Inside, you will discover where real hope can be found."}

THE LARGEST EARTHQUAKE IN 100 YEARS FOR CENTRAL NEW ZEALAND 16-Nov-2016 Firstly my heart-felt prayers to those who have lost their lives and who have suffered trauma and loss. (from Matthew 24:3-14 and 1 Chronicles 12:32). These unfortunate tragedies are all side-effects of the following issues. Many people do not realise the change in the earth. The environment has been speaking for some time to us about the burden of pollution and abuse that has serious outcomes. (Leviticus 18:24-28 - NKJV Bible) reads, Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for by all these the nations are defiled, which I am casting out before you. For the land is defiled; therefore I visit the punishment of its iniquity upon it, and the land vomits out is inhabitants. You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgements, and shall not commit any of these abominations, either any of your own nation or any stranger who dwells among you (for all these abominations the men of the land have done, who were before you, and thus the land is defiled), lest the land vomit you out also when you defile it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you. In Leviticus 18:24-28 is a sobering warning and insight to the connection of the land and sexual sins. (ie Mass Evacuations) No other sin in the whole of the bible has any connection to earthquakes, floods and volcanic eruptions, but Sexual Perversions alone. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now. (Romans 1:20 - NKJV Bible) reads, For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse. Some can be explained through the following human causes: Global Warming Ocean Pollution Water-way Pollution Fracking Mining Oil exploration 1080 poisoning And much more But there are some disasters that are directly related to the above scriptures and previous explanation.

A tsunami arrived about two hours later. Officials warned everyone along the eastern coast to head inland or for higher ground.

Last week's earthquake made those challenges even greater. Natural disasters reward governments: people tune into their elected officials for information, seeking assurance, comfort and guidance. That leaves no room for politicking. Not much. Source: 1 NEWS It's simply not enough to wait around until the public gets bored of your rival. The party recently had two golden opportunities to gain much-needed traction. And they blew it. Their annual conference was badly timed, coming just days before the US election when all eyes and minds were on Trump v Clinton. The launch of their thoughtful and substantial Future of Work report was overshadowed when leader Andrew Little chose to highlight a skills-shortage levy. It was a shallow policy that on the surface looked like a tax on migrants, even if Labour spent the rest of the weekend denying it. Source: 1 NEWS The fall-out of the conference was not as they could have hoped, and the party spent the rest of the week in a defensive crouch instead of leading a discussion about job insecurity and inequality. And here's the really frustrating thing. With their Future of Work Commission, Labour has tapped into a zeitgeist. It's the same civil instability and job insecurity that fuelled the TPP protests, tipped Britain towards Brexit and saw Donald Trump elected. The globalisation movement has peaked, and the free trade movement is beginning to unwind. And with the FoW commission, Labour were trying to come up with some honest and worthwhile solutions - instead of the reactionary anti-immigration recoil seen in US and UK politics. But, whether out of desperation or conviction, Mr Little chose to jump on that band-wagon, with a dog-whisper. At APEC at the weekend, Prime Minister John Key should have been drowning in a weight of howling derision over the failure of the TPP. National has championed free trade. He, personally, has invested a lot of time and political capital in the doomed deal. It was an opportunity for Labour to stick the boot in and harness that anti-globalisation mood - and recapture some of the ground lost over their hesitant and confused opposition to the TPP. But, they missed it. And here again, National has out-smarted Labour. National have recognised that there is little appetite for an income tax package - and such an obvious election bribe risks a backlash from those who feel forgotten. Labour lack edge. But they can't see it. Which is fine, but he does need voters to like him - a vinegary and prickly approach to criticism is not an adequate counter to Mr Key's affability. Labour isn't entitled to govern just because they've been out of office for a while. They must work for the chance - and so far, they aren't.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck just after midnight in a mostly rural area that's dotted with small towns. Near the epicenter, it opened up snaking fissures in roads and triggered landslides. It caused damage in Wellington, the capital, more than 200 kilometres (120 miles) to the north and was also strongly felt in the city of Christchurch to the south. Residents said the shaking went on for about three minutes, and was followed by a number of strong aftershocks. Police said one person died in the small coastal town of Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. The quake completely cut off road access to Kaikoura, said resident Terry Thompson, who added that electricity and most phones were also down in the town of 2,000, a popular destination for tourists taking part in whale-watching expeditions. Thompson was out of town but managed to reach his wife by cellphone during the night before her phone died. His wife helped a 93-year-old neighbour and a tourist into her car and drove to higher ground, he said. Prime Minister John Key said waves of about 2 metres (6.6 feet) hit the coast but the tsunami threat had since been downgraded to coastal warnings. He said authorities had no reason to believe the death toll would rise above the two reported fatalities. Key said officials had decided not to declare a national emergency because the nation's regions were able to adequately cope with the situation. The quake temporarily knocked out New Zealand's emergency call number, 111, police reported. In Wellington, it collapsed a ferry loading ramp, broke windows and caused items to fall from shelves. It also forced hundreds of tourists onto the streets as hotels were evacuated. Authorities in Wellington were urging people who work in the centre of the city to stay home on Monday. City officials said that some large buildings were showing signs of structural stress, and the quake would likely have caused a mess in some buildings. The city's suburban rail network was shut while crews checked tracks, bridges and tunnels. earthquake that struck Christchurch in 2011, destroying much of the downtown area and killing 185 people. Although Monday's quake was stronger, its epicenter was deeper and much farther from major urban areas. Location, depth and other factors beyond magnitude all contribute to the destructive power of an earthquake. New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management reported that a tsunami wave struck at about 1:50 a.m. and warned residents living in low-lying areas anywhere along the country's east coast to move to higher ground. There was confusion about the tsunami threat throughout the morning. The quake was centred 93 kilometres (57 miles) northeast of Christchurch, according to the US Geological Survey. The USGS initially estimated it had a magnitude of 7.4 before revising it to 7.8. It said the quake struck at a depth of 23 kilometres (14 miles), after initially putting the depth at 10 kilometres (six miles).

These observations provide the first quantification of seafloor landscape change and large-scale sediment transport associated with an earthquake-triggered full canyon flushing event. These observations demonstrate that earthquake-triggered canyon flushing is a primary driver of submarine canyon development and material transfer from active continental margins to the deep ocean. Our knowledge of how this sediment and the entrained carbon and nutrients are transferred to the deep ocean via continental slope canyons is based on the geological record (4). Flushing is hypothesized to nourish deep-sea benthic ecosystems through rapid export of organic material from the continental shelf (8) and to drive incision of canyon substrates, making this the primary process in submarine canyon morphological development (9). This event-driven morphological development is analogous to terrestrial canyon systems, where significant amounts of incision can occur during individual flood events (10). Better understanding of the dynamics and triggering of canyon flushing will help resolve how the cross-margin transfer of geological and organic material occurs, how submarine canyons develop, and how their benthic ecosystems function. Reconstructions from sedimentary records show that canyons undergo flushing infrequently (102- to 103-year time scales), and on passive margin canyons, this might occur only during periods of glacially lowered sea level and direct sediment supply (7, 12). Determining the role of canyon flushing events in canyon development and margin-scale sediment dispersal requires direct and timely evidence that is currently lacking because the relative rarity of flushing events has precluded direct observation of their impacts. We draw on a data set of pre- and post-earthquake bathymetry, seafloor video, and sediment core samples. This data set enables us to quantify the scale, timing, and seafloor impacts of a canyon flushing event for the first time, placing quantitative constraints on this important global process.

Blue lines show the major active tectonic structures. Yellow circles show locations where the coseismic turbidite has been sampled, scaled to deposit thickness (T). The bottom right inset shows the detailed morphology of the entrenched Hikurangi Channel with coseismic turbidite sample sites indicated by stars. S2). During the first phase of coring, 4 days after the earthquake, the deposit was still highly fluidized and settling from the water column at the sediment-water interface. The elevation difference between the channel axis and overbank levee sites indicates a minimum flow height of 180 m above the channel floor (Fig. 2C). Hence, the flow likely propagated far beyond 680 km down-channel. This is the first time a long run-out turbidity current has been sampled immediately following the coseismic triggering event. (A) Photographic image, x-ray computed tomography (CT), sedimentology (c, clay; z, silt; fs, fine sand; ms, medium sand), and excess 234Th chronology (234Thex) for representative cores from the Hikurangi Channel floor and levee demonstrating very recent turbidite emplacement. See Fig. 1 for transect locations. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the surficial deposit was emplaced from a very recent sediment density flow. The surficial turbidites had exceptionally high fluid content, lacked bioturbation, were underlain by an oxic layer indicative of recent seafloor surficial sediments, and contained fresh biological remains (fig. S2 and table S2). Proof of very recent sediment emplacement is provided by the radioisotopic activity of excess 234Th (234Thex). Because of its 24-day half-life, a normal 234Thex profile through the seafloor will show rapid decay within a few centimeters of the sediment-water interface. To the north and south of the landslide morphology, a comparatively smooth and sediment-draped upper slope defines the limit of canyon rim sediment failure. S5) (19). Both the northern and southern transitions between the undisturbed and disturbed canyon rim correlate to the peak ground acceleration contours between 0.38g and 0.44g, defining the threshold for canyon rim failure during this ground-shaking event.

In the mid-canyon region, 200- to 300-m-diameter depressions in the canyon floor have deepened by 20 to 30 m. We calculate a spatially averaged erosion depth of 5.6 m over an approximately 11-km2 middle reach of the canyon, where bedrock was exposed before the earthquake. Deposition also occurred in upper- to mid-canyon areas but appeared to be localized and of limited thickness (generally less than 5 m; Fig. 3A). Sediment waves in the lower 35 km of the canyon, with amplitudes of 10 to 20 m and an average crest spacing of 250 m, were substantially modified from their pre-earthquake configuration (Fig. 3, D and E). In the central canyon, where sediment waves do not span the full canyon floor, down-canyon migration and reorganization of sediment waves occurred (fig. S7). In the lowermost canyon, sediment waves cover the entire canyon floor and are known to be constructed predominantly of gravel and boulders (16). Digital image correlation (20) of the repeat bathymetry shows that pre-existing sediment waves moved down-canyon by up to 560 m but maintained the same planform configuration (Fig. 3D). Because this calculation does not include sediment shed from the steep canyon walls, this is a minimum eroded volume. The direct impact of canyon erosion and transmission of sediment through the canyon is apparent from the effect this has had on the benthic ecosystem. Repeated seafloor photographic transects along lines first surveyed in 2006 show evidence for significant benthic impacts from the 2016 earthquake, with no indication of the exceptionally high biomass communities of benthic invertebrates previously recorded in sediments at the head of the canyon (Supplementary Materials) (17). Three months after the earthquake, seafloor imagery shows a drape of soft sediment with occasional rock falls and a complete absence of any sign of benthic metazoan invertebrate life. The interevent time is consistent with previous recurrence estimates for turbidite records recovered from this canyon (16) and allows us to quantify the role of earthquake-triggered canyon flushing in the morphological development of canyons, the flux of sediment and carbon to the deep ocean, and the structure and function of deep-sea benthic ecosystems. DISCUSSION The morphological development of submarine canyons that have incised 1000 m into the continental slope requires erosion into underlying bedrock substrate, which is commonly armored by coarse bedload material (24). Our data show that canyon flushing not only mobilizes bedload, exposing the underlying substrate, but also drives canyon incision. This is 3 to 30 times higher than long-term river incision rates measured in the dynamic landscape of Taiwan (3) and is comparable to localized short-term rates in steep upland rivers where debris flows are the primary erosion mechanism (25). The incision rate calculated from our observations indicates that, on active continental margins, canyons could advance from inception to maturity in 105-year time frames. Because little is known about event-driven sediment transfer to the deep ocean, we consider our results in relation to well-documented short-term sediment fluxes from terrestrial systems. Fluxes of organic compounds to the deep ocean, such as those estimated by measurements of particulate organic carbon (POC), are coupled with this sediment transfer. Large fluxes of organic material into the deep ocean, which occur almost instantaneously in the case of canyon flushing, are likely to have an important influence on the regional productivity of ocean ecosystems and provide a pathway for sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere over geological time scales. CONCLUSION While the flushing of submarine canyons on active and passive continental margins can potentially be triggered by a variety of processes, including earthquakes, typhoons, and extreme river discharges, our results confirm long-standing hypotheses that, on active tectonic margins, earthquake-triggered canyon flushing is (i) the dominant process driving the transfer of sediment and organic matter from continents to the deep ocean and (ii) a significant driver of geomorphic change in canyons over centennial to geological time scales and hence of their long-term development. The complete removal of a major benthic community from the canyon system during canyon flushing also indicates that earthquakes regulate the structure of benthic ecosystems in active margin submarine canyons. This study provides the first direct evidence of the impacts of a full canyon flushing event on canyon morphology and quantitative data on the scale of coseismic sediment and organic carbon transport from continental landmasses to deep-ocean basins. High-resolution digital elevation models (25 m grid) obtained from multibeam echosounder data and TOPAS PS 18 sub-bottom profiler data were used to select core sites that were optimally situated to record turbidite deposition. Cores were photographed and logged visually in the field and then imaged ashore using a Geotek Ltd linescan camera, and x-ray CT was conducted on a GE BrightSpeed medical CT scanner set to 120 kV, 250 mA, a pitch of 0.625 mm, and a 100-cm2 window. Chronology Quantitative evidence for recent emplacement was provided by radiometric dating of turbidite sediments and underlying oxic layers that represent the paleo-seafloor using the short-lived radioisotope 234Th, which has a half-life of 24 days. Once sediment was isolated from seawater through deposition excess, 234Th activity became undetectable within five half-lives (120 days) of deposition. Consequently, the presence of excess 234Th in the turbidite and the sediments that immediately underlie it provided evidence for recent deposition. Excess 234Th was determined by repeat measurements, where the initial samples were measured within three half-lives of the earthquake (72 days). Supported 234Th was determined by remeasuring each sample after five half-lives (120 days) had elapsed. The reported excess 234Th activities were decay-corrected to the date of the earthquake. Sediment volume budget analysis Pre- and post-earthquake bathymetry were obtained from multibeam echosounder data processed using CARIS HIPS and SIPS. Soundings were automatically filtered, manually cleaned, tide-corrected using tide models, and combined into DEMs using the inbuilt CUBE algorithm. CUBE uses total propagated error to generate several sounding hypotheses to select optimal values. We used the difference of DEMs analysis developed for sediment budgeting in braided rivers and adapted to multibeam echosounder data for marine bathymetry (18). S2B), and using this combined uncertainty as a spatially variable threshold to provide lower-bound estimates of volumetric change at a set confidence level. The canyon walls were not included in the volume analysis because their steep slope resulted in uncertainty too high for the analysis; instead, we limited our analysis area to the gentler slope gradients of the canyon floor. Volumes of change (eroded, deposited, and net) and their respective lower-bound estimates were calculated for different areas in the canyon, as shown in table S4. Calculated volumes are provided in table S4. Canyon incision and flux calculations We used our localized incision rate to project what the long-term downcutting rate is for this canyon. We assumed that spatial distribution and magnitude of localized incision derived for this canyon flushing event were characteristic of the long-term incision and that the location of incision would occur at different locations in the canyon axis through time and over millennial time scales that affect the full length of the canyon axis. We calculate long-term incision rate Ilongterm (in millimeters per year) as where Ptotal is the total canyon profile length (in meters), Plocal is the local canyon profile length affected by incision during canon flushing (in meters), Ilocal is the local incision rate during canyon flushing (in millimeters), T is the event recurrence (in years), and U is the uplift (in millimeters per year). We calculated the biological and detrital material flux through the canyon associated with this event. Mass values were reported in metric megatons. These calculations were conducted for both the preferred and minimum limit of detection volume estimates. Reported uncertainties for Qs represent upper and lower bounds based on the minimum and maximum recurrence interval estimates.

Since the Kaikoura quake there has been 15cm of slip in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay - the same movement you would see following a magnitude 7.2 quake. And on Saturday GNS Science said it had noticed about 7cm of movement in Kapiti and Manawatu - equivalent to a magnitude 6.8 quake. It is the first time the institute has seen slow-slip movement in two different places simultaneously.

Photo: Getty Images JANUARY 2, 2018 Updated January 1, 2018 Thomas Coughlan Thomas Coughlan is a Newsroom reporter based in Wellington who writes on policy and economics. Thomas Coughlan talks to insurers. According to Aon Benfield, the insurance broker, nearly 15 percent of reinsurance capital now comes from pension funds, endowment funds and sovereign wealth funds investing in ILS. Even our own NZ Super Fund, under the leadership of Adrian Orr, the new Reserve Bank Governor, got in on the action. However, none of this wave of new investment will help New Zealand insurers diversify the risk on their books. Although our ever-present earthquake risk and high levels of coverage via the Earthquake Commission (EQC), a Crown entity, would seem to make New Zealand an ideal market for innovations in catastrophe cover, no insurers have sponsored ILS for their risks here. New solution to old problem ILS is just the latest solution to the perennial peril of the insurance industry: how to adequately diffuse risk. Today, insurance seems so quotidian that it almost obscures the genius at its heart. In 1680, spurred by the Great Fire of London, Nicholas Barbon wrote the first modern property insurance policy. The idea was simple: premiums paid by policyholders would finance a pool of capital sufficient to pay out on policies in the unlikely event of a fire. For his plan to work, he relied on the low probability that he would have to pay out on many of his policies at once. It was not until the 19th century that the insurance industry was forced to grapple with this problem. In 1842, the well-insured city of Hamburg was razed to the ground by an immense fire. As the dust settled, insurers in the city were inundated with claims and many folded. The solution to the plight of insurers was simple. If the basic principle of insurance is to diversify liabilities widely to minimise the likelihood of having to pay out on multiple policies at once, insurance companies simply needed to look further afield to hedge against a catastrophic event that triggered a high volume of claims. Reinsurance was born. By the end of the decade, Hamburg insurers were reinsuring their liabilities through dedicated reinsurance houses in other cities. This model was replicated in other countries and soon a network developed linking local insurers with global reinsurer, based on the shared incentive of diversifying risk as widely as possible. As our populations grow larger and more wealthy, insurers have greater liabilities in both volume and value on their books. However, institutions like EQC and its American equivalents have subverted this economy by allowing homeowners to take out policies against disasters that are both frequent and costly, increasing the global vulnerability of insurers and the clients they insure. Climate change is also a threat, increasing the frequency and intensity of catastrophic storms. A solution to this subversion was born in the early 1990s after a series of costly earthquakes and storms in the United States. Confined to the relatively small world of insurance and reinsurance, these disasters threatened the stability of the entire industry. It became clear that insurers would need to find another layer of diversification. American insurers hit upon the idea of diversifying their risk throughout a far larger capital pool than the world of reinsurance. The idea makes relative sense. The world of insurance and reinsurance is relatively small. Wall Street, on the other hand, is massive. Thus was born the cat bond, an innovative financial product that allowed insurers to access the greatest pool of capital ever to exist. Incredible growth The process of issuing a cat bond (the most common ILS) is relatively simple. Investors would place capital in the SPV and in return they would be paid an annual coupon based on a calculation of the relative likelihood of the catastrophe occurring on top of a market interest rate. If the catastrophe occurred, the SPV would liquidate all or part of the assets to transfer to the insurer; if it did not, the total value of the bond would be transferred to the investor upon maturity, earning them a healthy profit over the time they held the bond. The markets loved it. The last decade has seen incredible growth in ILS. This is largely the product of good timing. Loose monetary policy since the global financial crisis has driven down yields for the types of bonds favoured by large, institutional investors. As a new and untested asset class, yields for catastrophe bonds remained relatively high, with coupons sporting antediluvian yields, sometimes up to 20 percent, proving intoxicating for investors making do with yields on government bonds in the low single digits. By 2015, four-fifths of new cat bond issues were bought by pension funds. Traders who specialise in cat bonds are more likely to spend their days watching the weather for signs of a hurricane than analysing financial data looking for a crash. The frenzy has continued. As demand ramps up for catastrophe bonds from yield-starved investors, insurers have found a seemingly endless supply of catastrophe risk to repackage and sell them, especially as demand for the bonds pushed down the cost to insurers of issuing them. However, real-world events towards the end of the year gave the market something of a reality check. Tim Richison, chief financial officer of the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), the Californian equivalent of EQC, is one of the insurers reaping the benefits of the current appetite for ILS. Richison was an early champion of cat bonds. He was associated with the team that put together one of the first cat offers in the 1990s. Now at the CEA, he is the third-largest sponsor of cat bonds in the world. Interest for ILS has surged significantly since the financial crisis of 2008, giving Richison immense savings. This is because the cost of sponsoring a cat bond is more or less fixed. Obviously the more risk an insurer can offload at once, the less significant those fixed costs become. The current high demand has incentivised insurers to sponsor far larger issues of bonds, allowing them to defray their high fixed costs over the large issuance. Richison is himself partly responsible for the reason 2017 established a new record for cat bond issuance. One of the reasons for the size of the issue was that Richison and the CEA realised that the high demand for cat bonds meant they could diffuse their high fixed costs over a larger amount of risk. This does not mean, however, that the bonds are any more likely to be used in New Zealand. Monnier believes the high fixed costs of establishing cat bonds will mean that New Zealand insurers will continue to mainly rely on traditional reinsurance, as their liabilities are small by global standards and are most efficiently retained within a reinsurer's balance sheet. The cost of issuing cat bonds is still too great for New Zealand insurers to diffuse amongst what would inevitably be a relatively modest issuance. He calculates that minimum ILS yields for less risky layers would be around 2 per cent for New Zealand earthquake risk. But at these levels, many New Zealand insurers would not contemplate sponsoring cat bonds. This means that New Zealand risks may need to be bundled with other perils in order to meet investors' minimum return hurdles and be attractive to the funds that sustain the market today. Though the costs for New Zealand insurers would be relatively high, there is a market for our kind of catastrophe. Richison sees, in future, a strong investor appetite to purchase New Zealand risk to diversify portfolios that are heavily weighted towards US earthquake and wind events. One body in New Zealand that could make a difference is EQC. This could encourage the commission to look at the most cost-effective way of managing its liabilities. Currently, the EQC Act of 1993 prohibits EQC from using anything other than traditional reinsurance to diversify its risk portfolio. However, a Treasury review from 2015, commissioned to recommend changes to EQC following the Christchurch Earthquakes, suggested amending the Act to allow EQC to purchase alternative financial instruments to traditional reinsurance. In June, the previous Government outlined some of the measures of the Treasury report it planned to implement in 2020. But it never got round to amending the Act. The biggest problem could be political. Sarah-Alice Miles, a Christchurch specialist in earthquake insurance, is skeptical of their long-term future.

Nelson Marlborough District Health Board said five people had been admitted to Wairau Hospital by early this morning with various injuries, some described as moderate. Follow our full coverage: Earthquake: What you need to know LIVE: Earthquake updates as they happen Scores of aftershocks rattle country Kaikoura cut off by road Earthquake: In pictures The first quake struck at 12.02am, near Hanmer Springs, at a depth of 16km. It was followed by a series of large earthquakes across New Zealand up to 6.2 in magnitude, which prompted tsunami alerts, causing residents of coastal areas to flee inland. GNS science said there had been at least 250 aftershocks since the massive shake just after midnight, with more than 30 of them above magnitude 5, and three of magnitude 6 and above. Most were in the upper South Island, in Seddon and Kaikoura, but a 4.9 magnitude earthquake hit Paraparaumu and a 4.9 hit Wellington in the early hours. The Civil Defence ministry said roads were closed on State Highway 1 between Blenheim and Picton, State Highway 6 between between Blenheim and Nelson, and State Highway 7 between Springs Junction and Waipara. It warned people to check for any dangers on damaged properties including to gas and water supplies. The earthquake sequence is the biggest since the 5.7 Valentine's Day earthquake, which caused cliffs in the Christchurch suburb of Sumner to fall and liquefaction in some east Christchurch areas.

A tsunami at least 2m high was recorded near Kaikoura, Civil Defence tweeted. The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management has now cancelled the tsunami warning that was in place from Wellington to Banks Peninsula. But it said coasts may still experience unusual, strong currents and sea level fluctuations lasting for several more hours. KiwiRail said all trains on the North Island Main Trunk line, south of Palmerston North, and in the South Island had been cancelled until further notice. Ferry sailings were also cancelled until a full assessment could be made of the terminals in Wellington and Picton. The Ministry of Education advised schools and early childhood centres from North Canterbury through to Wellington would remain closed today. It also said all NCEA Scholarship exams would be suspended. Police earlier said they were trying to get access to the Mt Lyford property where one person was thought to have died. Three evacuation centres were open in Christchurch. At 5am there were 230 people at Linwood College, 50 at Mairehau School and 25 at Akaroa School Hall. Hotel guests in central Christchurch were evacuated. More than 100 people stood on the footpath opposite the Christchurch Casino, while at least 100 hotel guests were outside the Novotel, opposite the Christ Church Cathedral. Alan Vincent was on the water near Lyttelton near Christchurch when the quake struck. A temporary boil water notice has been issued in Hurunui. A welfare centre was set up at the Amberley Pavilion. Christchurch police have set up roadblocks to stop people going to coastal areas while a tsunami warning was in place. New Brighton resident Dean Kozanic evacuated his home as a precaution because of the tsunami warning. He said many residents in the suburb had been doing the same. Power was cut in North Canterbury, from Kaikoura to Cheviot. The Hurunui District Council said Rotherham and Waiau were isolated by slips and damage to the bridge. He said bridges north of Blenheim had been damaged, but there was a diversion in place. Fiona Redfern, of Muzzle Station on the Clarence River, warned neighbours on Facebook that the Dart Stream tributary had become dammed due to a slip and a flash flood could come at any time. Several people spent hours stuck on the Interislander Ferry, which was unable to dock in Picton due to a power cut. Other ferry movements were suspended for the day. Marlborough Civil Defence said buildings in Picton's main street were reported to be badly damaged, and the earthquake had caused liquefaction on the Picton foreshore. Twenty people were receiving welfare help in the Ward Town Hall in Marlborough. The area from Seddon to Ward had been checked by helicopters and some damage to electrical transmission poles had been found which could take days to repair. There was a diversion in place on SH1 between Picton and Blenheim, which was open for some vehicles but heavier vehicles could not get through and were reported to be banked up for several kilometres along the highway. Picton residents were asked to conserve water as one of the town's reservoirs was leaking. An evacuation centre was being opened at the Waikawa Marae. The Nelson Marlborough District Health Board said by early this morning five people had been admitted to Wairau Hospital with various injuries, some described as moderate. Spark said its phone networks in Clarence, Kaikoura, Weld Cone, Waiau and Eltham in the South Island have been affected. People should text rather than call if possible, it said. Power went out in many areas including Picton, Blenheim and Havelock. Lansdowne Park in Blenheim was also closed due to liquefaction. Several multi-story buildings received damage - both internally and structurally - and glass fell into streets. Power was out in some areas, and Civil Defence controller Bruce Pepperell said early indications were that a number of major buildings showed signs of structural stress and the strong quake would likely have caused a mess inside. Mr Pepperell said the capital's suburban rail network would not be operating until further notice, while rail tracks, bridges and tunnels were checked. Buses were unlikely to replace the trains. He said 25 buildings in the CBD had so far been identified as having suffered potential structural damage. The damage had been referred to building owners for detailed examination by engineers, Mr Pepperell said. Some city streets were showered with broken glass during the quake and it was feared strong winds tonight could dislodge more glass. Land movement of up to 1m has been reported on reclaimed land on the waterfront with large cracks opening up in concreted areas. Wellington Harbour Master Mike Pryce said he and port operator CentrePort were still assessing the earthquake damage to the waterfront including liquefaction. CentrePort said it would issue an update on the situation shortly. Cheers for the concern all, everyone's ok. People who left their homes in the city centre were told they could find temporary refuge at the BizDojo Centre on 115 Tory Street, or Houghton Valley School further out of the city. Residents in coastal areas were urged to stay inland or on high ground. Affected spots include seaside areas of Wellington's south coast, Seatoun and Eastbourne. Civil Defence in Otago said the land-based threat to the eastern coasts had passed and people were being allowed to go home. The controller for Clutha district, Charles Hakkaart, said the main evacuations were in low-lying houses in Pounawea, Taieri Mouth and Toko Mouth. The quake struck near Hanmer Springs Photo: Supplied Chatham Islands About 40 people were evacuated from their homes on the Chatham Islands, mainly in the settlement of Kaingaroa, and more made their own way to higher ground. Chatham Islands mayor Alfred Priest said the island was the path for tsunamis from both New Zealand and South America, and locals were good at responding to the threats."}

Emergency response teams flew by helicopter to the region at the epicenter of the tremor, which struck just after midnight some 91 km (57 miles) northeast of Christchurch in the South Island, amid reports of injuries and collapsed buildings. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Powerlines and telecommunications were down, with huge cracks in roads, land slips and other damage to infrastructure making it hard to reach the worst-affected areas. A tsunami warning that led to mass evacuations after the original quake was downgraded after large swells hit New Zealand's capital Wellington, in the North Island, and Christchurch. Wellington was a virtual ghost town with workers ordered to stay away while the city council assessed the risk to buildings, several of which were damaged by the tremor. Severe weather with 140 km per hour (85 mph), gale-force winds was forecast for the area. Hundreds of aftershocks, the strongest a 6.2 quake at about 1.45 p.m. local time (0045 GMT), rattled the South Pacific country, fraying nerves in an area where memories of a deadly 2011 quake are still fresh. Christchurch, the largest city on New Zealand's ruggedly beautiful South Island, is still recovering from the 6.3 quake in 2011 that killed 185 people. New Zealand's Civil Defence declared a state of emergency for the Kaikoura region, centered on a tourist town about 150 km (90 miles) northeast of Christchurch, soon after Monday's large aftershock. Kaikoura, a popular spot for whale watching, appeared to have borne the brunt of the quake. The Navy's multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury was heading to the area, he said. Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) said a 20-person rescue team and two sniffer dogs had arrived in the town. A second team was on standby in Christchurch, USAR said in a statement. TWIN QUAKES Hours after the quake, officials said a slip dam caused by the quakes that had blocked the Clarence River north of the town had breached, sending a wall of water downstream. A group of missing kayakers was later reported safe. New Zealand's Geonet measured Monday's first quake at magnitude 7.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey put it at 7.8. The quakes and aftershocks rattled buildings and woke residents across the country, hundreds of kilometers from the epicenter. Government research unit GNS Science later said the overnight quake appeared to have been two simultaneous quakes which together lasted more than two minutes. Around 90 percent of the world's earthquakes occur within this region. Stock exchange operator NZX Ltd said markets were trading, although many offices in the capital were closed. The New Zealand dollar initially fell to a one-month low before mostly recovering. Fonterra, the world's biggest dairy exporter, said some its farms were without power and would likely have to dump milk. Key postponed a trip to Argentina, where he had planned to hold a series of trade meetings ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summit in Peru this week, as he met disaster officials. Two other people were pulled alive from the same building. New Zealand media reported one of the pilots taking rescuers to the area was Richie McCaw, the recently retired captain of New Zealand's world champion All Blacks rugby team. Shortly after the quake, residents heeding tsunami warnings in Wellington caused gridlock on the roads to Mount Victoria, a hill with a lookout over the low-lying coastal city."}

The town of Kaikoura, a popular base for whale-watching about 150 km (90 miles) northeast of Christchurch, the South Island's main city, was completely cut off by massive landslips. Four defence force helicopters flew in to the town today morning and the Navy's multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury was heading to the area, Air Commander Darryn Webb, acting commander of New Zealand joint forces, told TVNZ. Around 1,200 tourists were stranded in the town, officials said, and other emergency services were also using helicopters to fly in supplies and fly out those who wanted to leave. Mark Solomon, a leader of South Island indigenous Maori Ngai Tahu tribe, which has tourism and fisheries businesses around Kaikoura, said the local marae (Maori meeting place) had received 1,000 people since Monday morning. Many slept overnight in the communal hall or in vehicles outside. The tribe had fed them with crayfish, a delicacy for which the South Island town is famous. With no power, the tanks that hold the expensive crustaceans had stopped pumping. AFTERSHOCKS, WIND AND RAIN Gale-force winds and rain were hampering recovery efforts, and hundreds of aftershocks continued to rock the region. A 5.4 tremor was among the bigger aftershocks felt as far away as Wellington on Tuesday. China chartered four helicopters to evacuate around 40 nationals, mostly elderly and children, from Kaikoura late on Monday, said Liu Lian, an official at the Chinese Consulate in Christchurch. One Chinese national had been treated for a minor head injury in Kaikoura's hospital, Liu said, and around 60 others would be evacuated on today. Many planned to continue journeys to other parts of New Zealand, Liu said. The repair bill was likely to run into billions of dollars, he said. Civil Defence estimated 80,000-100,000 landslides had been caused by the quakes. Acting Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee said New Zealand had accepted an offer of two US Navy helicopters from the destroyer the USS Sampson, as well as an offer of help from the Japanese military. Workers began returning to office buildings in Wellington's business district, which was closed off on Monday while the city council assessed the risk to buildings. Several blocks were damaged by the tremor, including the offices of Statistics New Zealand, which said the release of economic data had been halted and that it would be months before it could use the building. An A-League soccer match scheduled for Saturday between the Wellington Phoenix and Australia's Melbourne Victory has been postponed because of damage to Wellington's 34,000-seat Westpac Stadium, officials said. The venue had been cleared of major structural damage but had sustained burst water pipes, cracked concrete and broken windows. Christchurch is still recovering from a 6.3 magnitude quake in 2011 that killed 185 people. If removed, widths should be individually defined on each content DIV then.

Resident Stephen O'Dwyer said he was on the beach with his wife walking their dog when the cliff in Sumner started to collapse. Water was coming up under the sand and people were sinking down to the ankles as the ground went soft. The quake sent large clouds of dust billowing over the suburb. During the tremor, which was reportedly felt across the South Island, some shops in Christchurch were evacuated and photos on social media showed items that had fallen off shelves.

Published on Nov 13, 2016 Phone footage captured the moment a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nelson just after midnight local time (11:02 GMT on Sunday). The origin of the quake was registered by the US Geological Survey some 95km (59 miles) from Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island. Following the quake, a tsunami hit the north-eastern coast of the island. Authorities warned residents to evacuate coastal areas and head inland, or onto higher ground. Christchurch is still recovering from a deadly earthquake in 2011, which destroyed the city centre and killed 185 people. Category News & Politics Show more Show less Loading...

Powerlines and telecommunications were down, with huge cracks in roads, land slips and other damage to infrastructure making it hard to reach the worst-affected areas. Wellington was a virtual ghost town with workers ordered to stay away while the city council assessed the risk to buildings, several of which were damaged by the tremor. There were concerns that loose glass and masonry could be dislodged by severe weather hitting the capital, with 140 km per hour (85 mph) winds forecast. Hundreds of aftershocks, the strongest a 6.2 quake at about 1.45 p.m. local time (0045 GMT), rattled the South Pacific country, fraying nerves in an area where memories of a deadly 2011 quake are still fresh. Kaikoura, a popular spot for whale watching, appeared to have borne the brunt of the quake. Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) said a 20-person rescue team and two sniffer dogs had arrived in the town. A second team was on standby in Christchurch, USAR said in a statement. Police in the area around Christchurch reported 19 burglaries of homes and commercial properties after the quake as residents headed for higher ground. TWIN QUAKES Hours after the quake, officials said a slip dam caused by the quakes that had blocked the Clarence River north of the town had breached, sending a wall of water downstream. A group of kayakers missing on the river was later reported safe. A railway track lies damaged alongside State Highway One near Kaikoura on the upper east coast of New Zealand's South Island following an earthquake, November 14, 2016. The quakes and aftershocks rattled buildings and woke residents across the country, hundreds of kilometers from the epicenter. Geonet said four faults had ruptured, with one at the coast appearing to have slipped as much as 10 meters (33 feet). Government research unit GNS Science said the overnight tremor appeared to have been two simultaneous quakes which together lasted more than two minutes. Stock exchange operator NZX Ltd said markets traded normally, although many offices in the capital were closed. The New Zealand dollar initially fell to a one-month low before mostly recovering. Two other people were pulled alive from the same building.

Hours later, another strong quake measuring 6.4 magnitude struck the same region, northeast of Christchurch, around the small town of Hanmer Springs, according to Geoscience Australia. The New Zealand Ministry of Civil Defense and Emergency Management warned people living near the coast to move inland to higher ground as tsunami waves raised seawater levels in some places by about six feet. Prime Minister John Key said the earthquake had killed at least two people, Reuters reported. Glasses broke and furniture moved at Premier House, the official prime ministerial residence in Wellington, Mr. Key said. He had stayed there overnight after meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry, who was on a state visit there and to Antarctica. Geoscience Australia said the 6.4-magnitude earthquake was one of three large aftershocks that measured between 5.1 and 6.4 magnitude. There have been at least 12 aftershocks since early Monday morning in New Zealand. Caroline Little, a spokeswoman for GeoNet New Zealand, which monitors geological hazards, said seismologists had modeled the probability of the number and intensity of aftershocks on Monday morning. She described it as a zigzag rather than a single fault and said this would affect the way aftershocks played out. The New Zealand Herald reported that one of the confirmed deaths was caused by a heart attack and that the other had taken place on a historic homestead near the beach town of Kaikoura. Military helicopters flew there to assess the damage after roads were destroyed. Image People were evacuated from buildings along Dixon Street in Wellington. The first earthquake struck about 50 miles southwest of Kaikoura and 50 miles north of Christchurch. Elliot Fim, a regional official in Christchurch, said in a telephone interview that there were no reports of damage, injuries or fatalities there. The Fire Department was dealing with a large number of emergency calls. Mr. Fim said people living along about 200 miles of coastline had been evacuated. A spokesman for the Wellington Region Emergency Management office said there were reports of minor damage in the capital. In 2011, an earthquake measuring 6.3 magnitude devastated Christchurch and killed 185 people. The earthquake on Monday was about 40 to 50 times as large as the one in 2011, Mr. Jaksa said. In Cheviot, a small town thought to be close to the epicenter, there were no reports of casualties. Mr. Burnett said that some properties along the coast had been evacuated, but that none had been seriously damaged by the surge in seawater. The fire brigade went door to door to check on residents. The earthquake occurred in the Hikurangi Trench, a subduction zone where one tectonic plate slides under another. Correction : An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a beach town close to the location of one of the deaths. It is Kaikoura, not Kiakora. Correction : An article on Nov. 14 about an earthquake in New Zealand measuring 7.8 magnitude misidentified the tectonic plate that includes North Island and the northern part of South Island, both in New Zealand. They are on the Australian plate, not the Pacific one. The article also reversed the directions of the Australian and Pacific plates. The Australian is moving north and the Pacific, west.

Earlier on Sunday, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake centered north of Christchurch killed two people and damaged buildings, with tsunami waves caused by the quake arriving two hours later. On Monday, the committee invited Ford to testify next Monday in front of the panel regarding the alleged assault. The letter from Ford's lawyers demanded an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh before Ford will talk to the committee, and revealed that she has received death threats and had to leave her house. Grassley did not explain why, if Ford was given several dates and her lawyers did not respond to the invitation until Tuesday, he announced on Monday that the hearing would take place next Monday. Ford's legal team revealed this in a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday. In addition to receiving death threats, Ford's email has been hacked and people are pretending to be her online. The committee announced on Monday it would be holding a public hearing next Monday, giving senators a chance to hear from Kavanaugh and Ford and ask them questions. It is highly unlikely Republicans will agree to change the date, and they could still hold the hearing on Monday without Ford. The Senate Judiciary Committee had scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh for this Thursday, but delayed it for Monday's hearing. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. In an interview with Queerty, Mark Saltzman said while writing for the characters, he used his own experiences with his partner. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that produces Sesame Street, quickly released a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying that not only are Bert and Ernie not gay, but they don't have a sexual orientation, period. Should Bert and Ernie weigh in on the matter, this report will be updated. Trump said he would consider the request. Poland is closely watching Russia and its military moves, and Trump believes that having a presence in the country would keep Russian President Vladimir Putin in check. They respect strength, as anyone does. The abuse took place between 2003 and 2009 at St. Lucy's-St. Patrick's Church in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, when the boys were between the ages of eight and 12. The New York Times reports that the boys were repeatedly abused by 67-year-old Angelo Serrano, a lay teacher of religion and director of religious education; he was arrested in September 2009 and pleaded guilty in 2011 to first-degree sexual conduct charges. Serrano is now serving a 15-year prison sentence. This is one of the largest settlements ever reached with victims of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. In an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday, Ford described how Kavanaugh attempted to rape her at a party when they were both in high school in the 1980s. Judge, Kavanaugh's high school classmate, was in the room when it happened, Ford said, and Ford was able to escape when Judge jumped on top of her and Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the incident. Ford and Kavanaugh are both scheduled to testify publicly to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the allegation next week."}

The earthquake left coral and seabed exposed above the ocean in a matter of minutes. One of the worst hit towns was Kaikoura, which lies close to the epicenter of the earthquake. What is now called the Kaikoura earthquake occurred in the South Island of New Zealand where multiple fault lines ruptured in sequence along a complex fault system. The large 7.8 magnitude earthquake is the world's third largest earthquakes to occur in 2016 and second of all time to occur in New Zealand in recent times. Two deaths were reported in Kaikoura and Mount Lyford, one from a heart attack and the other from a collapsed house near Kaikoura. Rescuers saved over 600 Kaikoura residents who were evacuated by helicopter and boat to Christchurch. Remarkably, the earthquake rupture traveled northward at a rate of 2 km per second over almost 200 km, initiating a line of ruptures associated with the one earthquake. In fact, the maximum release of energy occurred 100 km to the north of the epicenter. This all occurred along a complex fault system, thought to include more than six individual faults. New Zealand experienced significant aftershocks following the major 7.8 magnitude earthquake as seen in the diagram below. The U.S. Geological Survey recorded over 60 aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 or greater following the main earthquake. Aftershocks from the recent 2016 New Zealand earthquake show hundreds of events, diminishing in size with time. (Credit: Wikipedia) Movement along the fault caused a large swatch of seabed near Kaikoura to raise 6 feet into the air, creating new coastline and exposed seabed. This is not the first time the coastline has been modified by an earthquake. The 1931 Napier earthquake modified the coastline significantly along Hawkes Bay in New Zealand. The earthquake movement was largely horizontal, which limits our ability to visually see offset between the two fault planes. However, some of the slip movement was vertical, allowing for movement of the fault plane to be easily seen in the uplifted seabed. New Zealand regularly experiences significant earthquakes as it sits at the intersection of the Indo-Australian and Pacific plate. The relative motion of the two plates against one another causes sticking points that then release causing an earthquake.

Source: New Zealand Defence Force Main Quake Summary: Live Updates: 3.40pm: The Governor-General, Dame Patsy Reddy, has postponed her planned trip to the Nelson-Tasman region due to the earthquakes. Government House says with emergency efforts in the upper South Island, the timing is not right for a regional visit, and it will now take place sometime in the New Year. 3.30pm: The severe 5.8 aftershock at 2.34pm was felt by around 7000 people around the country, according to GeoNet, with 24 of them classing it as extreme. 3.00pm: Several hundred people gathered in Kaikoura earlier this afternoon to hear from authorities. They say the priority is to evacuate tourists and they hope to be able to lead a convoy out of Kaikoura via the inland route on Saturday if it can be cleared in time. There was a big sigh from the crowd. Authotities said the priority is to restore water supply for everyone. 2.54pm: The cluster of aftershocks was felt in Parliament. MPs grabbed their seats as the building was rattled. 2.44pm: There's been a swarm of severe, moderate and light earthquakes ranging from magnitude 3.1 to 5.3 in the Seddon area. Also a moderate 3.5 quake 20km east of Taupo and a light 3.6 quake 25km west of Timaru. 2.34pm: Severe 5.8 quake, 30km northeast of Kaikoura at a depth of 21km, and a 5.7 quake 20km southeast of Seddon and five minutes later a 3.5 tremor 15 km southeast of Seddon. 2.30pm: Twelve patients have been airlifted from Kaikoura to Christchurch with injuries including laceration, broken hip, head injury and a pregnant woman needing additional care, says Health Minister Jonathan Coleman. In Kaikoura, the Minister says he understands five patients who were on supplemental oxygen at home have been taken into the town's healthcare facility which was able to continue functioning on a generator. This morning the hospital had seven acute patients admitted with minor injuries as well as 14 long term patients and four spare beds. GPs have also seen 36 patients, 18 for medical conditions and 18 for minor quake related injuries. The community nurses have teamed up with the local four wheel drive cliub to access vulnerable patients and two of those were transferred to Christchurch where they could move in with relatives. A clinical psychologist has been flown from Canterbury to help support the community. 2.12pm Wellington's Westpac Stadium has been cleared of major structural damage, however superficial damage will need repairs meaning this weekend's Phoenix football game against Melbourne Victory will be postponed. Burst water pipes, concrete cracking and spalling, broken windows and some liquefaction was just some of the damage to the stadium. 2.05pm NZTA has released an updated list of the current conditions of South Island highway routes: SH6 is currently closed from Rai Valley to Renwick due to surface flooding. The Transport Agency is working urgently with Kaikoura District Council to open the inland road (route 70) between Culverden and Kaikoura. Cheviot to Christchurch is open. An alternative inland state highway route was re-established on Monday afternoon between Picton and Christchurch, via Murchison and the Lewis Pass, re-establishing access for local communities and allowing large trucks access through to Christchurch. State Highway 7A, giving access to Hanmer Springs from State Highway 7, re-opened at 7am today after being closed overnight due to the risk of further rockfalls. The agency has urged people to avoid non-essential travel and to drive with extra caution. The NZ Defence Force says 5000kg of aid supplies, including food, water and hygeine products, are currently at Christchurch waiting to be delivered to Kaikoura. Earlier today four Air Force NH90 helicopters were deployed to evacuate tourists and residents. 1:24pm Christchurch couple Michael and Shirley Carmody who were feared missing in Kaikoura, have been located safe and well. 1:20pm Civil Defence says its priority in Kaikoura is evacuating tourists to save resources for the community. They say the shortage of water is a major concern. There are plans in place to send remaining people out in vehicles in a convoy on Saturday; aiming to use the inland route. 1:02pm Transport Minister Simon Bridges says his biggest priority is getting access into Kaikoura. Mr Bridges says both light and heavy vehicles will have access through the road meaning truck will supplies will be able to get through to the town. But it's not so good news regarding State Highway One which is blocked north of Kaikoura. There have been empty helicopters spotted leaving Kaikoura. 11:40am A group of evacuees who had been stranded in Kaikoura have landed in Woodend, North Canterbury after being flown out on a NH90 NZ Air Force helicopter. 11:30am Labour leader Andrew Little has cancelled his planned visit to India and Pakistan in the wake of the earthquakes. He says now is not the time for politics. 11:18am New World Kaikoura has opened. The store is structurally sound. Customers are advised to shop as normal. 11:05am John Key has said the Americans have offered the USS Samson's two helicopters to assist with operations in Kaikoura. They will also add a P-3 Orion to ours to assist with surveillance. Malaysia have also offered a helicopter. The US navy ship is in New Zealand for NZ Navy commemorations. Talking to media today Mr Key says the Government's is looking to get 140 high priority people out of Kaikoura as soon as possible. Mr Key says the Government is looking to potentially give support to people without insurance affected by the quakes. 10:25am The Red Cross is organising a system to prioritise the needs of elderly, pregnant woman and those with children with over airlifting them out. 10:14am Nelson Bays Police are investigating the theft of several firearms, some of them antique pieces which were taken from an address when the occupants had evacuated because of the tsunami threat. They were taken from an address in Riwaka at about 7.30am yesterday morning. Police are keen to speak to a male Eurpoean in his mid to late thirties wearing a grey hoodie and black pants who was riding a red push bike in the area at the time. Anyone with any information is encouraged to contact Nelson Bays Police on 03 546 3840. 9:41am The Defence Force are organising 16 flights today to airlift tourists out of Kaikoura. Four choppers are leaving in the next hour. Red Cross is currently organising a system to prioritise the needs of elderly, pregnant woman and those with children. The flights are weather dependent and will continue while it's fine. 9:20am Christchurch man Patrick Carmody has not heard from his elderly parents, who are in Kaikoura, since Sunday afternoon. His father is Michael Carmody, 76, and his mother is Shirley Carmody, 66. The couple were staying in the Peketa Beach Holiday Park in Kaikoura when the earthquake struck. 9:03am Ten additional police officers from Auckland are due on the ground in Kaikoura this morning after their flight was turned back due to severe winds and turbulence last night. The additional officers will provide support to the emergency response in the affected areas, as well as assist in general policing duties and community patrols. Police are still in the process of notifying the families of the two people who died following the earthquakes and will release their names once this process is complete. Police say there have been no major issues reported to them overnight regarding further damage or casualties caused by aftershocks or weather. There have also been no law enforcement issues reported in Kaikoura. 8:50am Two ships are expected to arrive in Kaikoura tomorrow morning with supplies, Civil Defence Canterbury advises. Engineering staff are en-route to the landslide dam site on the Clarence River this morning to assess any residual risk remaining after the dam breach yesterday afternoon. 8:41am Bad weather is preventing Defence Force helicopters flying in to Kaikoura. They are hoping to fly in at around 11am to midday when the weather is forecast to get better. Those evacuated from north of Kaikoura will be taken to Ward. 8:36am The Wellington District is experiencing inclement weather this morning which is causing delays for commuters.

Ministry of Justice members of the Public Service Association will strike from 10.30am to 12.30pm today. PSA National Secretary Glenn Barclay said on Monday that eleventh hour meetings were held between the PSA Bargaining Team and Ministry of Justice to reach a resolution but no movement on fundamental pay issues was offered. He said the union is seeking an outcome that ensures members including court security officers, registry officers, victim advisors, court reporters and Family Court coordinators are reasonably paid. He said the ministry offered the third lowest average salary in the public sector last year and the PSA believes this is being worsened. Kaitaia District Court. SHARE SHARE Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Topics New Zealand Internet Scientist and entrepreneur Sir Ray Avery will have to go to the district court if he wants to pursue his complaint about media website Newsroom any further. Sir Ray complained to Netsafe under the Harmful Digital Communications Act, regarding five articles Newsroom had published about fundraising he was doing for his LifePod inventions, and about his other past products. He said the articles caused him severe emotional distress and amounted to harassment and digital harm under the Act. Newsroom has refused to take the articles down. Netsafe Director Martin Cocker said there isn't anything more Netsafe can do through mediation. That mediation process is a mandatory first step under the Act, and most Harmful Digital Communications Act complaints are sorted at this point. However Mr Cocker said the main thing they do to get resolution, is to advise parties on what the likely legal ramifications are of different actions that they might take. In this case, Mr Cocker said, there is not clarity in the Act about how these particular cases should be handled. Mr Cocker said if they did not feel they could progress the case, their advice was to consider taking it to the district court. Sir Ray Avery. Source: 1 NEWS Topics New Zealand Internet What to do and what not to do if you come across a kiwi in the wild 1 NEWS SHARE SHARE Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Topics New Zealand Animals Conservation A rare daytime encounter with a kiwi on the Heaphy Track got TVNZ1's Seven Sharp thinking - what to do and what not to do when you come across the native bird in the wild. The Department of Conservation (DOC) says it's pretty unusual for these nocturnal birds to be out during sunshine hours. As we all know kiwi don't fly so escaping predators can be pretty tricky. An average of 27 are killed every week, so we've got to be pretty careful around them. DOC gave Seven Sharp some important tips to remember if you encounter one of these unique birds. Firstly stay still and just enjoy the rare experience. Stay a few metres away and don't worry if they approach you, just keep still. Second, don't move towards the bird or try to pick it up - it's an offence to hold kiwi without permission from DOC. Also, be weary of their sharp claws - they're wild animals and can get stroppy. Lastly, feel free to take photos or video, but only in low light conditions and don't use a flash as it can stun the birds."}

Earthquakes can cause damage to buildings and roads. Knowing what to do immediately following an earthquake can prevent injury and save lives. Every household should create and practice a Household Emergency Plan. It's also important to have emergency survival items and a getaway kit. As well as this, every household should plan and practice what to do in the event of an earthquake. What to do Pick safe places in each room. Practice drop, cover and hold. Make sure your home and critical buildings are securely anchored to their foundations. Secure heavy objects both inside and outside the home. If you are outside, find a clear spot and drop to the ground. If you are inside when the shaking starts, move no more than a few steps to a safe place and drop, cover and hold. It makes you a smaller target, stops you being knocked over and protects your head, neck and vital organs. Expect aftershocks. Check yourself and then others. Look for fires. Move to high ground or as far inland as you can. Walk if you can. Stay there until you get the all clear. Download our hazard app to help you make it safely through a disaster.

Most are too small to be noticed, but between 150 and 200 are big enough to be felt. Ground shaking from earthquakes can cause buildings and bridges to collapse; disrupt gas, electricity, and telephone services; and sometimes trigger landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires, and tsunami. Buildings with foundations resting on unconsolidated landfill or other unstable soils are at increased risk of damage, as are homes not attached to their foundations. In general, damage to buildings is the main cause of financial loss from earthquakes. Collapse of buildings is the main cause of casualties, either through crushing or entrapment. Loss of services is the main cause of people becoming displaced.Learn if earthquakes are a risk in your area by contacting your local council. Information about earthquake risk is also available on the GNS Science website. 30 April 2015 Red Cross in action following earthquake in Nepal As search and rescue efforts continue, hospitals in the capital continue to function but are stretched to the limit.

They were being taken to Blenheim in vehicles, a Civil Defence spokeman said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The evacuees were from homes nearby the slip and much of the area between the slip and the river mouth was farmland. It was likely residents at the eight to 10 farms self evacuated and Civil Defence personnel would check in with them in the morning, he said. Homes near the river mouth were evacuated this afternoon. A group of rafters, who were rescued earlier today, and around 20 Marlborough tourists, were also driven to Blenheim. A dozen kayakers reported missing on the Clarence River have been found safe. The group, from the National Outdoor Leadership School, were evacuated by chopper today, the Civil Defence spokesman said. Police contacted the rafters via satellite phone and pinpointed their location when the call was made. A helicopter from Nelson hovering over the river spotted the breach. Civil Defence ground teams were en route to the river. Water had built up behind the slip, about 10 to 12 kms upriver from the mouth. The water broke through the dammed-up debris around 4.20pm. Civil Defence is urging nearby residents to get to higher ground immediately. Emergency workers began evacuating nearby residents around 3.30pm, before the slip breached as a precautionary measure. Earlier today, Fish and Game urged anglers to steer clear of the Canterbury river, due to a slip blocking the river in the vicinity of the Dart Stream, with a lake forming behind the blockage. Gretchen Dalzell, who guided tours on the Clarence River last season, told Fairfax there would have been four to five guides experienced on grade two rivers like Clarence on today's trip. They must have left around Thursday or Friday last week. We start at Jacks Pass, about a 40-minute drive from Hanmer, and get into the Clarence River from there. We're quite aware it's a very steep valley, and there are lots of areas you might camp where, in an earthquake, it would be quite treacherous. There's the potential for lots of rockfall. She said the guides would have had emergency management training and known how to use a satellite phone and administer first aid.

On Tuesday alone, there have been 177 quakes between 6am and 1pm; with 34 aftershocks in the hour since midday alone. Kaikoura Earthquake. Sarah Stuart-Black, director of civil defence, told reporters that damage has been reported to properties in the South and North islands. Stuart-Black said the first priority for Kaikoura is water supply: more is being transported in today and the fire service is taking in a water treatment plant. The transfer of supplies has so far been mainly through helicopter air support; Canterbury will be delivering larger loads, as well as evacuating tourists and locals who want to leave. By midday on Tuesday, 34 people had been airlifted out, including some relocated for medical reasons. Some locals in Kaikoura have taken tourists into their homes, she said.

Food and fuel resources are also low, though local restaurants and residents have donated much of their own stores to the relief effort, including seafood and crayfish. The local marae (Maori meeting house) cooked and served meals for up to 700 people on Monday, Radio NZ reported, and planned to do the same again on Tuesday. The New Zealand military dispatched helicopters from Wellington, and HMNZS Canterbury left Auckland on Monday night stocked with relief supplies. Its journey south was slowed by severe weather and rough seas. Webb said the military planned to begin using four NH90 helicopters that could each transport about 18 people out of the town at a time. It was estimated HMNZS Canterbury may be able to reach Kaikoura by lunchtime on Wednesday.

Military helicopters and a navy ship have been dispatched to rescue about 1,000 tourists, along with residents, who are stuck in the coastal town of Kaikoura, South Island, which has been cut off from land access. Meanwhile, torrential rain and gale-forced winds have hampered the relief efforts and further disrupted life for many New Zealanders, with the capital, Wellington, flooded.

PETER DOCKRILL 7 MAY 2018 What is thought to be the largest known sinkhole in New Zealand has ripped open across a farm on NZ's North Island, revealing a gigantic cavernous void estimated to have been decades or even a century in the making. Only later in the day, when visibility was improved, did the sheer scale of the gaping chasm become apparent. A volcanologist says it may have been growing underground for up to 100 years before recent heavy rain opened it up. After a period of intensive rainfall at the end of April that lasted for about a week, the last of the rock's resistance gave way, opening up to reveal this jagged, 200-metre-long (656 ft) ravine that looks like something out of the movie 2012. The 20-metre (66 ft) depth of the hole isn't just vertigo-inducing. It also offers a fascinating scientific cross-section to geologists, showing the gradual build-up and layering of rock, sediment, and soil over unimaginably long timescales. Thanks to that decisive deluge, volcanologists and landslide scientists will be busy over the next few weeks, inspecting the chasm, and seeing what they can learn from it. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 55 minutes ago NATURE A Pulsating, Alien-Looking Sea Creature Has Been Found on a Beach in New Zealand It's mesmerising. 1 hour ago HEALTH These Simple Tips For Storing Fruits And Vegetables Will Help You Keep Them Fresh Longer You might be doing it wrong. 2 hours ago NATURE Terrifying 'Rafts' of Stinging Fire Ants Are Now Floating Around After Hurricane Florence Locals are being warned to avoid them at all costs.

Topics New Zealand Music Alcohol Auckland Russian troops sweep across Siberia in war games with China amid tensions with US Associated Press SHARE SHARE Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Facebook Twitter Google Plus Email Topics New Zealand Hundreds of thousands Russian troops have swept across Siberia in the nation's largest ever war games also joined by China - a powerful show of burgeoning military ties between Moscow and Beijing amid their tensions with the US. Moscow said the weeklong Vostok (East) 2018 manoeuvres will span vast expanses of Siberia and the Far East, the Arctic and the Pacific Oceans and involve nearly 300,000 Russian troops - nearly one-third of the country's one-million-strong military. They will feature more than 1,000 aircraft, about 36,000 tanks and other military vehicles and 80 warships. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has described the drills as even bigger than the country's largest Cold War-era exercise called Zapad 1981 that put NATO allies on edge. A retired Russian general said that the giant war games come as a warning to the US against ramping up pressure on Russia. China is sending about 3,200 troops, 900 combat vehicles and 30 aircraft to join the drills at a Siberian firing range, a significant deployment that reflects its shift toward a full-fledged military alliance with Russia. Mongolia also has sent a military contingent. As the manoeuvres kicked off, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russia on Tuesday to attend an economic forum in Vladivostok. President Vladimir Putin treated Xi to pancakes with caviar and shots of vodka in a show of their warm rapport. However, the military drills they had until now were far smaller in scale, reflecting China's caution about alliances. Some experts pointed out that the US helped spawn closer Russia-China military ties by labelling them strategic competitors. He noted that China feels that the Washington's hostile attitude and actions, such as deploying the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea, relieve it of any need to take US views into consideration when deepening strategic trust with Moscow. The Chinese media touted the Chinese involvement in the manoeuvres as the country's largest-ever dispatch of forces abroad for war games. Some noted that the People's Liberation Army, which hasn't fought a war since the attempted invasion of Vietnam in 1979, is keen to learn from Russia's experience in the Syrian campaign, where it tested its latest weapons and tactics."}

HMNZS Canterbury is on its way from Auckland to also help evacuate 1100 stranded tourists. The Elms Homestead in Kaikoura collapsed following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake at 12.02am, and rescuers spent hours searching for the three residents. A Fire Service spokesman said one of the woman was able to escape the large home themselves, while the other was rescued. The man did not survive. Well-known locals Pam and Louis Edgar live at the property with Louis' 100-year-old mother, Margaret. Relatives are desperately trying to get into Kaikoura which has been cut off by large slips blocking the only access roads. Helicopters are currently being used to evacuate people from the coastal settlement, which still has no power. EARLIER At least two people have died and several others have suffered non-fatal heart attacks and minor injuries following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Emergency services have confirmed one death at the Elms Homestead in Kaikoura. Three people live at the historic home. One person was able to escape, one was rescued and third has died. Relatives of the family are having trouble contacting emergency services due to congested phone lines and power cuts. A second person has died of a heart attack at a property in Mt Lyford and there are reports of several people suffering non-fatal heart attacks in the hours following the main quake. St John has activated its National Crisis Coordination Centre and has set up local Emergency Operation Centres in the South Island. A spokeswoman said St John staff, resources and emergency equipment have been relocated to higher ground, and resource is being moved to affected areas in order to maintain response capability. Casualty numbers and injury numbers are unknown at this stage. Speaking from the Beehive's civil defence bunker, Prime Minister John Key said all 16 regions had activated civil defence requirements. Tsunami warnings replace in place for much of the East Coast where ways of up to 2m have already stuck. If you are in a low lying area on the East Coast of the North, South or Chatham Islands move immediately to higher ground. He also confirm the two deaths. Acting Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee said the pressing need was to get communications gear in to cut off areas and that would be the first task for the helicopters. He said there weren't reports of many homes or other buildings brought down. While there had been reports of items falling from shelves, some cracks in buildings and smashed windows in Wellington the true extent of property damage is being revealed as emergency service workers begin assess infrastructure and homes in the light of day. Pictures are coming in of large slips and badly damaged roads in the Hurunui District. The small North Canterbury town Waiau, where a bridge has been badly damaged, is shut off. Kaikoura has also been cut off but reports of bad damage are hard to substantiate due to power cuts, blocked roads and a congested mobile network. Military helicopters would be going there to assess damage and make contact. The Fire Service is also sending a seven-strong Urban Search And Rescue squad from Christchurch by helicopter. Assessment teams are also being sent to Waiau and Blenheim. In Wellington the TSB Arena and BNZ Centre have sustained the most damage. There is damage to wharves and the Inter Islander terminal, and the Tory Channel remained closed. Shipping workers were forced to flee the Kings Wharf freight shipping terminal in Wellington, after cracks began appearing and water spurting from beneath them. The man said he and seven of his colleagues all ran out together, and huddled to protect themselves in case glass or debris fell from nearby buildings. In Marlborough, emergency services are bracing themselves for an influx of calls as people see the extend of the damage. Rural fire chief Richard McNamara said there was a number of vehicles stuck on State Highway 1, and a helicopter was waiting to survey the road in daylight. He urged people not to travel unless it was urgent, because there was already congestion. McNamara said welfare centres in Rarangi and Waikawa were sheltering about 100 people, including residents of a rest home. Previous Advertisement Advertise with NZME. 14 November 2016.

Email New Zealand's military leaders say they have almost completed the evacuation of more than 700 tourists and residents from a small coastal town, two days after a powerful earthquake cut off train and vehicle access. The magnitude 7.8 quake left two people dead, triggered a small tsunami, and brought down rocks and mud that swept across highways. Air Commodore Darryn Webb, the acting commander of New Zealand's Joint Forces, said crews were loading about 380 people and three dogs onto a navy ship which is due to leave on Wednesday evening for a six-hour trip to a port near Christchurch. Air Commodore Webb said it had evacuated another 340 people by helicopter since Tuesday. Other tourists have left by chartering their own helicopters or having air transport provided by their embassy, while others have chosen to stay until an inland road reopens. Warships from Australia, Canada and the US are due to arrive soon and will help restock the town with water, fuel and other supplies as well as transport equipment. Australian honeymooners Kurt and Kailah Sapwell were among the tourists stuck in Kaikoura but they did not seem too bothered by their ordeal. They said they had all the essentials they needed: a place to stay, food and water. Home to about 2,000 residents, Kaikoura was a popular destination for travellers wanting to go on whale-watching expeditions before the quake hit. On Wednesday, Mr Key promised business owners the government would provide financial assistance for them through what is going to be a tough summer. US president-elect Donald Trump called Mr Key to pass on his sympathies over the quake. Neil Walker, the highways manager for the New Zealand Transport Agency, said the road remains high-risk and unsuitable for cars, although crews are working to open it to the public by the weekend. In the capital, Wellington, several streets remain cordoned off after engineers determined that a nine-storey office building is in danger of collapsing. Brendan Nally, the regional commander for the New Zealand Fire Service, said engineers were completing an inspection of the building when they found a major vertical beam had failed above the fifth floor. Wellington Mayor Justin Lester said the building would likely have to be demolished. He said he did not believe it posed a risk to public safety because of the precautions authorities had taken in evacuating the area around it.

The quake has lifted the seabed up by two metres in some places - a phenomena which has puzzled scientists. And it provides a valuable opportunity for scientists and geologists, marine geologist Dr Joshu Mountjoy told the website. Co-seismic movement, the seismic release of energy along a fault, was behind the phenomenon, he said. While some faults move side-to-side, others move vertically and the after-effects from the most recent earthquake look as if they moved vertically and pushed land upwards. The quake has thrust up the seabed by metres in some places, meaning the whale watching boats that once plied Kaikoura Harbour may no longer be able to dock there. The ocean floor has altered to such an extent that the impact on marine life is unclear, casting a shadow over the local fishing industry. Same location as helicopter pic.

The claims were made by US researchers Roger Bilham and Rebecca Bendick who found that when Earth's rotation decreased slightly, it was followed by periods of increased numbers of intense earthquakes five years later. Earth's rotation began one of its periodic slowdowns more than four years ago meaning next year should see a rise in major earthquakes, according to the research. Some of these yield statistically defendable correlations; others don't. Dr Tim Stahl, lecturer in tectonic geology at University of Canterbury, said while Professors Bilham and Bendick are respected scientists in earthquake geology and seismic risk, he wants to see their study peer-reviewed.

The first wave of the tsunami arrived at Kaikoura just before 2am local time on Monday, according to the NZ Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management. So intense was the initial tremor that it left fractures metres wide and deep along the country's major highway, and completely flattened a farmhouse not far from the epicentre. Incredibly a 100-year-old woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the farmhouse after rescue workers searched for hours for her, her son and her daughter-in-law. The woman's son died when the building collapsed. Prime Minister John Key confirmed the deaths of two people and said he had ordered a military helicopter to the Kaikoura region which has been cut off. There have been reports of looters ransacking houses that were evacuated when the powerful quake, while some supermarkets were also forced to ration their supplies as locals stocked up on bread, milk, water and meat. The Civil Defence has warned 'destructive waves' will continue and people on the country's east coast have been ordered to move to high ground. Although, those alerts have now been downgraded to 'coastal warnings'.

Police are investigating a spate of burglaries that took place in the wake of a deadly earthquake. A number of residents in Canterbury, on the country's South Island, evacuated their homes when the tremors hit.

In the early hours of Monday, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake centred north of Christchurch jolted the country and triggered a tsunami. As well as dealing with the huge cleanup ahead, authorities are also hunting for those responsible for three break-and-enters in evacuated houses in Christchurch. Christchurch has not fully recovered from an earthquake in 2011 that killed 185 people. Authorities have asked people in Wellington to stay away from work on Monday because of the dangers posed by aftershocks and the damage caused to some buildings. The city's suburban rail network has been shut while engineers inspect the tracks, bridges and tunnels for any damage.

The quake, at a depth of 62 miles (100 kilometers), struck shortly after 1400 GMT about 16 miles north of the city Chilecito in the South American nation's La Rioja province. Villagers reported that the movement was felt in the neighboring provinces of Catamarca, Tucuman and Cordoba. The country's seismic authority also reported three smaller earthquakes Sunday. The quake near the border with Chile follows a 6.4-magnitude earthquake of 'great intensity' earlier this month in central Chile. That earthquake shook buildings in the capital Santiago, causing panic among residents, whose frantic phone calls clogged cellular networks and land lines, AFP correspondents said. Marie Black, a local councillor who lives about 50 kilometres north of Christchurch, told the New Zealand Herald there were reports of damage to buildings in the North Canterbury region. 'It was a significant shake, I have felt several aftershocks and it is very unnerving,' she said. Sirens have been heard along the coast, warning people to evacuate, and the Civil Defence has reported some power cuts. Evacuees have posted images on social media of long traffic jams leading to Mount Victoria in Wellington and ferries hurriedly moving away from the shore line.

St John Ambulance said they began responding to injuries from the quake around 1am but did not specify how many people were injured or how, according to Radio New Zealand. The quake set of a series of aftershocks around the country, the largest of which was felt in Wellington on the south end of the North Island. At about 12.40, the Wellington area was hit with a 6.2 magnitude earthquake. A magnitude 4.9 earthquake moved struck the centre of the north Island at about 10 minutes later.

Hannah Gin had just sat down in her living room to watch a replay of this weekend's All Blacks versus Italy rugby match when her house started shaking. Upstairs, her mother let out a scream. Miss Gin, a 24-year-old lifelong Christchurch resident, is accustomed to quakes, so she said she sat calmly and waited, figuring the rumbling would stop in a few seconds. Instead, the shaking just went on and on - for at least three minutes, according to the clock on her phone, she said by phone. The quake was far less violent than the one that struck her city in 2011, Miss Gin said, adding that there was no jarring up and down or side to side, just a long, rolling sensation. But it went on for much longer than the typical quakes that strike the area, she said. 'I could hear the sliding door sliding back and forth and we've got washing hanging up and I could see the washing moving,' Miss Gin said. Bottles litter the floor of a supermarket in Miramar.

Patson Nthali posted a video on Facebook of his home continuing to shake after the earthquake ended. 'Still shaken up a little bit, yep, we're still shaken up, so joys of being in new Zealand, you get to have earthquakes,' Mr Nthali said, noting it was the first time he had experienced an earthquake.

In the next month, the chance of such a quake rose to 32 per cent. There was a greater chance of being hit by a slightly lower band of aftershock, from 6 to 6.9 on the Richter scale. The chance of one hitting in the 24 hours after the original quakes was 71 per cent. During seven days, that rose to 93 per cent. The chance of such a significant aftershock in the next month was 98 per cent. McBride said the two earthquakes hit one after the other. It appears to explain the phenomena which left many expressing astonishment at how long the earth shook. She said the quakes were different types of seismic shift. Felt aftershocks (eg magnitude greater than 5) would occur from the 7.5-magnitude epicentre near Culverden, right up along the Kaikoura coastline to Cape Campbell over the next few weeks and months. It meant aftershocks would most likely hit from Christchurch north to Wellington and out to Golden Bay.

Two people are confirmed dead. Several main roads and rail lines have been badly damaged and are impassable. Thousands of people were evacuated to high ground after a tsunami warning was issued. The warnings were lifted, but people remain advised to stay away from waterways due to strong waves and currents. Kaikoura, a town of about 2,000 people, in the South Island, has been almost completely isolated with roads closed and phone lines down. There is a state of emergency in place for the town. One thousand tourists will be airlifted out over the coming days, and a frigate is also en route to evacuate people. It could be two weeks until the roads reopen. There are severe weather warnings for the northern parts of South Island, which could hamper the response effort. The Clarence river dam has been breached, sending a wall of water downstream and threatening farms. Scientists think the quake might have actually been two quakes in separate faults. A strong 6.8-magnitude aftershock hit near Cheviot in the South Island. A 100-year-old woman has been pulled alive from the rubble of a collapsed homestead.

Mr Brownlee says he was just doing his job raising questions about the class action with a law firm, prompted by a letter placed in the mailboxes of his constituents. Ms Thorn said at the end of the call the man identified himself as National MP Gerry Brownlee. His call was prompted by a letter encouraging owners of new Christchurch builds to allow the law firm to investigate if they have non-compliant steel in their homes, after three mesh companies were found guilty of selling the product. The law firm used a public relations company to complain to National leader Simon Bridges' office about the call and are awaiting a response. He spoke to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee about his goal to visit his brother and friend overseas while he was still in good health. For more on this story, watch 1 NEWS at 6pm.

KiwiRail has notified that it intends to resume inter-island rail operations from 18 September 2017. However the service will be limited with slower transit times between Auckland and Christchurch. Plus with the nature of further slips and aftershocks, repairs on the rails have experienced the most disruption which means the road network will be the more favoured method of transporting items. Once the roads are open for business, we will endeavour to make collections and deliveries via the islands a much smoother operation. However if you are planning to use Seven Seas Worldwide in areas affected by the earthquake, please be aware that the reopening of these routes to full capacity will be a slow and meticulous process.

The 7.8-magnitude tremor struck just after midnight on Sunday, destroying farm homesteads, sending glass and masonry toppling from buildings in the capital, Wellington, and cutting road and rail links throughout the northeast of the ruggedly beautiful South Island. As aftershocks continued to rattle the region, emergency services cordoned off streets in Wellington and evacuated several buildings due to fears one of them might collapse. Four defence force helicopters flew in to the town on Tuesday morning and two navy vessels were heading to the area carrying supplies and to assist with the evacuation, Air Cdr Darryn Webb, acting commander of New Zealand joint forces, told TVNZ. About 1,200 tourists were stranded in the town, officials said, and other emergency services were also using helicopters to fly in supplies and fly out those who wanted to leave. Mark Solomon, a leader of South Island indigenous Maori Ngai Tahu tribe, which has tourism and fisheries businesses around Kaikoura, said the local marae (Maori meeting place) had received 1,000 people since Monday morning. Many slept overnight in the communal hall or in vehicles outside. The tribe had fed them with crayfish, a delicacy for which the South Island town is famous. With no power, the tanks that hold the expensive crustaceans had stopped pumping. Many planned to continue journeys to other parts of New Zealand, Liu said. Gale-force winds and rain were hampering recovery efforts, and hundreds of aftershocks continued to rock the region. A 5.4 tremor was among the bigger aftershocks and was felt strongly in Wellington. The repair bill was likely to run into billions of dollars, he said. Civil Defence estimated 80,000-100,000 landslides had been caused by the quakes. New Zealand media reported that three cows filmed stranded on a small patch of grass surrounded by landslips near Kaikoura had been rescued by a farmer. Acting civil defence minister Gerry Brownlee said New Zealand had accepted an offer of two US navy helicopters from the destroyer the USS Sampson, as well as an offer of help from the Japanese military. It was hoped an inland road to Kaikoura from the south could be reopened by the weekend, he said. Several blocks were damaged by the tremor, including the offices of Statistics New Zealand, which said the release of economic data had been halted and that it would be months before it could use the building. Christchurch is still recovering from a 6.3 magnitude quake in 2011 that killed 185 people. Sign In Invalid email or password."}

It triggered a tsunami alert that sent thousands of people fleeing for higher ground across large parts of the country's rugged coastline before the threat abated. Local residents Chris and Viv Young survey road damage near the town of Ward, south of Blenheim Credit: Reuters Credit: Reuters Rescuers were left scrambling to reach Kaikoura in the South Island, which had no telecommunications and was isolated by landslips, making it accessible only by helicopter. Civil defence minister Gerry Brownlee said a clearer picture of the scale of the damage was slowly emerging. Mr Brownlee and John Key, the prime minister, flew over the affected area in a military helicopter. Damage at the Waiau Lodge Hotel in Waiau, 120km (75 miles) north of Christchurch Aerial footage outside Kaikoura showed railway tracks ripped up and tossed 10 metres (30 feet) by the force of the quake. Landslips dumped hundreds of tons of rocky debris on the main highway while locals posted pictures of themselves near huge fissures that had opened up in roads. One person was believed to have died at a historic homestead which collapsed at the town, while police were trying to reach the scene of a fatality at a remote property north of Christchurch. It was felt across most of the country, causing severe shaking in the capital Wellington, about 250km (155 miles) away. The quake ignited painful memories for residents in nearby Christchurch, which was devastated five years ago by a 6.3 tremor which killed 185 people. Mr Key said he was well aware its impact could have been much worse. Earthquake engineer Ken Elwood, from the University of Auckland, attributed the relative lack of fatalities to the quake's midnight timing and the fact it hit a sparsely populated rural area. Soon after the earthquake, tsunami warning sirens were activated, with police and emergency workers going door to door to evacuate seaside properties. However, the largest waves were only about 2m before the alert was lifted. Hundreds of aftershocks, some stronger than 6.0, continued to rattle the country in the hours after the main quake. Forecasters predicted wild weather, including strong winds, overnight, hampering rescue efforts. More are coming from Auckland tonight.

Mr Key and Mr Brownlee estimated the clean-up would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and clearing the debris and blocked roads could take months. Defence force personnel were planning to take food, water and other supplies to Kaikoura on Tuesday.

The coastal town of Kaikoura has been completely cut off from the rest of the country by landslides. Flooding rains are compounding the problems. As aftershocks continue to rattle New Zealand, flooding and up to 100,000 landslides are hampering rescue efforts following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck near Christchurch on Monday. According to GeoNet, New Zealand's official source of geological hazard information, there have been somewhere between 80,000 to 100,000 landslides since the quake , with many roads closed indefinitely, CNN reports. The coastal town of Kaikoura has been completely cut off from the rest of the country by landslides, prompting a mass evacuation that began Tuesday. Some 200 tourists were rescued by the end of Tuesday, but the AP did not have any information on how many residents had been removed from the town.

A powerful but deep earthquake has struck west of Papua New Guinea.

Austhorities in Australia and New Zealand both said they had assessed the threat and there was no danger to their coastlines. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) downgraded the quake from an initial measurement of magnitude 8.0. It struck some 47kms west of Arawa on the north coast of Bougainville Island at a depth of 154km, USGS reported. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in an updated advisory that waves of 0.3m to 1m above tidal level were possible along the coasts of PNG and the Solomon Islands. It wound back an earlier alert that encompassed Nauru, Pohnpei, Kosrae, Vanuatu, Chuuk and Indonesia. Loti Yates, the director of the Solomon Islands National Disaster Management Office, said people had been told to move to higher ground in Choiseul and Western Province. Chris McKee, assistant director at PNG's Geophysical Observatory Office in Port Moresby, said there were no initial reports of damage from near the epicentre of the quake, which is sparsely populated.

The lethargic populace has accepted the intrusive restrictions, having chosen safety over freedom. Conformity is valued; non-conformity is seen as a threat. The story is written in the first-person of the protagonist, journalist Roy Farrington, who discovers that he is an iconoclastic non-conformist. T. J. Martinell has produced a gripping story with fascinating characters. My only criticism has to do with the editing (it needs another going-over) and the occasionally clunky formatting (I read it on a Kindle Fire). But do not let those minor matters stop you; the strength of the story itself overcomes them easily. I can't wait for the sequel, which Martinell is working on at present.

What was irritating was to have to fill in missing words or words that appeared to have suffered autocorrect issues. That should be an easy fix and a necessary one. With the government controlling all content on the Internet, newspapers make a comeback as a way to get news out without facing government scrutiny. The story follows Roy Farrington, an apprentice journalist, as he learns his craft and comes to straddle the worlds between government-controlled information and free-flowing newspapers. If it all sounds a bit intellectual and high-minded, it isn't. Martinell does an exceptional job crafting his vision of future America. The gangs running the underground newspapers allow him to paint a gritty underbelly of future Seattle, and the contrast between the modern, high-tech society with the noir-like ghettos that make up the newspapers' territory makes for riveting conflict. But there's also plenty of well-paced action for those just looking for a fun ride. If you're looking for both, this book definitely will not disappoint.

An initial tsunami warning was lifted but temblors continued Monday afternoon. A 6.2-magnitude quake struck around 1:30 p.m. 39 kilometers west-southwest of Kaikoura, further north of Christchurch.

The South Island has been hit by a flurry of aftershocks, according to the USGS and New Zealand's Geonet service, some with a magnitude above 6.0. Officials from the island's second-largest town, Dunedin, called a state of emergency there. Life in a 'collision zone' Residents around the epicenter reported shaking for minutes that sent grocery items flying from shelves. The USGS initially reported the quake's magnitude at 7.4 at a depth of just 10 kilometers -- shallow enough to cause serious destruction to the immediate surrounding area. It later revised the quake strength to 7.8, but changed its depth to 23 kilometers (14.2 miles), giving more of a buffer between the epicenter and the Earth's surface.

The 2011 quake had a depth of just 5 kilometers (3 miles). The shallower a quake is, the more destruction it tends to cause. The evil empire are after New Zealand's unobtainium. First shake up the locals, destroy infrastructure, weaken the economy and then extort deals to rape the resources of the country. So that people only discuss that as the possible reason. Right on top of a major fault line. It was seen off the Coast of Kaikoura on Nov. 13th, but its ETA from Panama was 10 am on Nov 14th in Wellington. The Amazon Warrior came from Panama, was seen off of Kaikoura on the 13th and then went to anchor off of Cloudy Bay at the top of the South Island, across the channel from Wellington. If you are steaming to NZ from Panama, and your destination is Wellington, then there is no need to go an extra 95 miles south before arriving at your charted destination; after a long sea journey of 7,353 miles. This fact alone shows that there was something very fishy going on in the state of Aotearoa. If their scheduled arrival was for 10am on the 14th in Wellington, then their trip to Kaikoura was already calculated into their original ETA. The AW's estimated project-to-project transit speed is 17 knots or 19.5633 mph. Thus traveling the 7353 miles to NZ will take around 16 days, and the last report in Vessel Finder was Oct 25, 2016 17:52 UTC which was probably the departure time from Panama. On a ship like the Amazon Warrior... to travel 95 miles distance from Kaikoura to Wellington it takes around 5 hours, so they have 1.75 days to engage in their seismic mayhem. The ship only pulled into Cloudy Bay to avoid the protesters at Wellington. Yea, rather obvious isn't it. The Amazon Warrior is owned by WesternGeco which is a geophysical services company. It is headquartered in the Schlumberger House on the property of London Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex, and also has an office in Denver CO. The company provides reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development services. The company, a business segment of Schlumberger, offers 3D and time-lapse seismic surveys, electromagnetic surveys, and multicomponent surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir management. The giant defense contractor Raytheon, now holds all 12 HAARP patents. HAARP devises can be made mobile on ships, such as the HAARP Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) platform. A HAARP phased array antenna system was transmitting the 2.5Hz ULF frequency and it triggered the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off of Japan and ensuing tsunami. DARPA is also developing an airborne version of HAARP. The Amazon Warrior is due to commence imminent seismic testing for oil on behalf of Norwegian Oil giant Statoil. Seismic testing involves the dragging of a seismic airgun along the seabed, emitting seismic blasts every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, from now until next May. Statoil acquired their permit from American multinational oil corporation Chevron, and the permit extends along the eastern seaboard and to depths that are unprecedented for New Zealand. One of the successor companies of Standard Oil, it is headquartered in San Ramon, California, and active in more than 180 countries. Standard Oil Co. Inc. was an American oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing company. Established in 1870 by John D. Rockefeller as a corporation in Ohio, it was the largest oil refiner in the world of its time. And smashed it with a hammer when it started to shake things to a dangerous level, which stopped the quake instantly. One of his basic working principles was resonance, mechanical and electromagnetic. It's how the Tesla coil drives up huge voltage on a low current. HAARP is an adaptation of Tesla technology used for nefarious purposes. Electromagnetic waves then bounce back onto earth and penetrate everything -- living and dead. Along with chemtrails and this heating of the atmosphere with HAARP dries up precipitation thus producing drought. I learnt somewhere they HAARP uses sunspot cycles, sunspots, solar flares, hurricanes, fault tension build ups etc... for a EMF assisted corporate-political warfare. HAARP is boost assist and director of natural energies. They can even reflect of the moon to generate massive explosions. In order to target the moon you need a steerable array and three arrays minimum are required. HAARP is capable of creating weather like hurricanes and tornadoes and tsunamis and earthquakes. Earth tomography is used by the oil and gas industry to find deposits. Tomography refers to imaging by sections or sectioning, through the use of any kind of penetrating wave or mechanical method. ELF waves or extremely low frequency waves can trigger an earthquake on faults that have built up tension. Plus this sortie was premeditated due to the original ETA, and so their actions were criminal and secretive...by going for the gold (oil) first before being invited into the country. Canadian wildfires, pipeline attacks in Nigeria and the Gulf Oil Spill are likely sabotage undertaken by Goldman Sachs to drive up prices for its own benefit. In New Zealand now, the Christchurch and Kaikoura quakes and the Rena shipwreck toxic spill event are acts of war against a sovereign nation for economic gain and to intimidate and demoralize Kiwis into submission to the poisoning and sacking of their country. 5 October 2011 the Rena ran aground near Tauranga, New Zealand, resulting in an oil spill. The spill has been described as New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster.The ship was carrying 1,368 containers, eight of which contained hazardous materials, as well as 1,700 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and 200 tonnes of marine diesel oil. Goldman Sachs Now Sees Chevron Better Off Than Exxon Mobil. These figures turn Goldman Sachs and its J Aron commodities division into the seventh largest gas marketer in North America.

While the 7.3 magnitude quake affected both Iran and Iraq, Iran bore the brunt of the overall destruction and casualties. Under the current sanctions regime, Iranian-Americans living in the U.S. are prohibited from delivering funds to their friends and family members. As Al Jazeera reported on Thursday, several attempts by Iranian-Americans to set up fundraisers for Iran in the days following the earthquake have been stymied by U.S. Treasury Department rules. In addition to killing hundreds and injuring over 9,000, a report from European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations found that the tremor damaged 12,000 buildings in Iran and Iraq. Read the senators' full letter: We write today concerning the recent earthquake that struck Iran on November 12. The latest reports indicate over 500 dead and thousands wounded, making this earthquake the world's deadliest of the year. We urge you temporarily waive any existing restrictions that would impede relief donations in order to speed the delivery of aid. While the earthquake affected both Iran and Iraq, most of the casualties are on the Iranian side of the border. After earthquakes in 2003 and 2012, the United States demonstrated its compassion and goodwill by offering assistance to the Iranian people and allowing private relief donations. The administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama both temporarily waived sanctions, and the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued general licenses to simplify aid delivery. Under the Bush administration, an OFAC license authorized U.S. persons to provide cash donations to nongovernmental organizations, U.S. and non-U.S., assisting with relief efforts in Iran. At the time, OFAC also worked with aid organizations to clarify rules on donations of food and medicine and which Iranian entities could receive aid and eased banking constraints to ensure the timely receipt of donations in Iran. While we understand that a general license issued by OFAC in 2013 allows for U.S. nongovernment organization to deliver aid to Iran, we urge you make it easier for U.S. citizens to contribute to nongovernment organizations not based in the United States that are currently providing relief aid to earthquake victims in Iran. Despite decades of animosity and no formal diplomatic relations, the United States has routinely offered to help the Iranian people in times of need. This time should be no different. We ask that you direct the Department of State to assist in aid efforts and to coordinate such efforts with OFAC and other relevant agencies in order to ensure aid arrives quickly.

The South Island has seen hundreds of tremors, including a 6.3-magnitude quake, after the initial one struck after midnight on Monday. The epicentre is northeast of Christchurch, near the town of Kaikoura which has been cut off by landslides. There are believed to be up to 1,000 tourists stranded in the town. Military helicopters and a navy ship are being sent to evacuate them and others from Kaikoura. GeoNet, a government-funded project monitoring earthquakes, said the first earthquake was actually two related tremors, and that aftershocks would continue over the next few months. New Zealanders pull together - Hywel Griffith, BBC News, Christchurch Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Residents in Wellington evacuated to one of the city's parks after the first earthquake struck after midnight As the aftershocks keep coming, Kiwis up and down the country are sharing the same emotions. Exhaustion from a sleepless night, concern for those still cut off from communication, and sadness for the two people who lost their lives. But there is also real relief. This earthquake was greater in magnitude than 2011's Christchurch tremor, but it didn't bring the same level of devastation. The cost of rebuilding will be huge - major parts of New Zealand's infrastructure have been twisted and snapped out of shape. But as is often the case when disaster strikes, New Zealand's people have pulled together, checked on their neighbours and offered each other a safe haven. Authorities spent all of Monday rescuing and evacuating residents along the east coast. New Zealand media reported that a 100-year-old woman and her daughter-in-law were pulled out alive from their home in Kaikoura, after the house collapsed in the first earthquake. The younger woman's husband died.

Some schools in the affected area have remained closed on Monday. Kaikoura, a popular tourist destination with a population of about 3,600, saw its main road blocked by landslides, with telecommunications, water and power supplies cut off. The operation to rescue those that remain stuck there could take several days, with each NH90 helicopter being deployed only able to carry 18 people at a time, Air Commodore Darryn Webb told the Associated Press news agency.

In case of the Hikurangi subduction zone, the Australian plate is overhanging the Pacific one. Earlier earthquakes that took place in such zones include the devastating 2011 earthquake followed by tsunami in Japan that claimed lives of thousands of people and triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster, as well as a 2004 Indonesia magnitude 9.0 earthquake that left as many as 250,000 people dead. A disaster that could potentially hit New Zealand would affect many heavily populated areas, such as Napier, Gisborne, Nelson, Wellington, Blenheim and Palmerston North. All those areas are located too close to the Hikurangi subduction zone for the scientists to issue a timely warning. In case of the Marlborough region, the people would have only between 10 and 30 minutes before a tsunami reaches them. The ongoing geologic activity could have been triggered by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that hit New Zealand in 2016. At that time, the tremors left giant cracks in the earth, destroyed buildings and roads, and left two people dead. In March 2017, the GNS issued a video explaining the situation in the Hikurangi subduction zone. Now an international team of scientists has launched a special project to study the area and improve their understanding of risks it could pose to New Zealand. All rights reserved.

Watch: Prime Minister John Key media conference The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management confirmed there had been two deaths from the earthquake. One person died in a house that collapsed in Kaikoura, and a second person died at a house in Mt Lyford, north of Christchurch. Mr Key said a Defence Force helicopter would be flying to Kaikoura and another one would be available in Wellington. An Urban Search and Rescue team from Christchurch was also on its way to Kaikoura by helicopter, along with two further assessment teams deployed to Waiau and Blenheim. As a result of the quake, Mr Key cancelled his proposed trade trip to Argentina, and will decide later this week whether to attend APEC in Peru next weekend.

Follow our full coverage: Earthquake: What you need to know LIVE: Earthquake updates as they happen Scores of aftershocks rattle country Kaikoura cut off by road Earthquake: In pictures The first quake struck at 12.02am, near Hanmer Springs, at a depth of 16km. It was followed by a series of large earthquakes across New Zealand up to 6.2 in magnitude, which prompted tsunami alerts, causing residents of coastal areas to flee inland. GNS science said there had been at least 250 aftershocks since the massive shake just after midnight, with more than 30 of them above magnitude 5, and three of magnitude 6 and above. Most were in the upper South Island, in Seddon and Kaikoura, but a 4.9 magnitude earthquake hit Paraparaumu and a 4.9 hit Wellington in the early hours. The Civil Defence ministry said roads were closed on State Highway 1 between Blenheim and Picton, State Highway 6 between between Blenheim and Nelson, and State Highway 7 between Springs Junction and Waipara.

A tsunami at least 2m high was recorded near Kaikoura, Civil Defence tweeted. The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management has now cancelled the tsunami warning that was in place from Wellington to Banks Peninsula. But it said coasts may still experience unusual, strong currents and sea level fluctuations lasting for several more hours. KiwiRail said all trains on the North Island Main Trunk line, south of Palmerston North, and in the South Island had been cancelled until further notice. Ferry sailings were also cancelled until a full assessment could be made of the terminals in Wellington and Picton. The Ministry of Education advised schools and early childhood centres from North Canterbury through to Wellington would remain closed today. It also said all NCEA Scholarship exams would be suspended. Police earlier said they were trying to get access to the Mt Lyford property where one person was thought to have died. Three evacuation centres were open in Christchurch. At 5am there were 230 people at Linwood College, 50 at Mairehau School and 25 at Akaroa School Hall. Hotel guests in central Christchurch were evacuated. More than 100 people stood on the footpath opposite the Christchurch Casino, while at least 100 hotel guests were outside the Novotel, opposite the Christ Church Cathedral. Alan Vincent was on the water near Lyttelton near Christchurch when the quake struck. A temporary boil water notice has been issued in Hurunui. A welfare centre was set up at the Amberley Pavilion. Christchurch police have set up roadblocks to stop people going to coastal areas while a tsunami warning was in place. New Brighton resident Dean Kozanic evacuated his home as a precaution because of the tsunami warning. He said many residents in the suburb had been doing the same. Power was cut in North Canterbury, from Kaikoura to Cheviot. The Hurunui District Council said Rotherham and Waiau were isolated by slips and damage to the bridge. He said bridges north of Blenheim had been damaged, but there was a diversion in place. Fiona Redfern, of Muzzle Station on the Clarence River, warned neighbours on Facebook that the Dart Stream tributary had become dammed due to a slip and a flash flood could come at any time. Several people spent hours stuck on the Interislander Ferry, which was unable to dock in Picton due to a power cut. Other ferry movements were suspended for the day. Marlborough Civil Defence said buildings in Picton's main street were reported to be badly damaged, and the earthquake had caused liquefaction on the Picton foreshore. Twenty people were receiving welfare help in the Ward Town Hall in Marlborough. The area from Seddon to Ward had been checked by helicopters and some damage to electrical transmission poles had been found which could take days to repair. There was a diversion in place on SH1 between Picton and Blenheim, which was open for some vehicles but heavier vehicles could not get through and were reported to be banked up for several kilometres along the highway. Picton residents were asked to conserve water as one of the town's reservoirs was leaking. An evacuation centre was being opened at the Waikawa Marae. The Nelson Marlborough District Health Board said by early this morning five people had been admitted to Wairau Hospital with various injuries, some described as moderate. Spark said its phone networks in Clarence, Kaikoura, Weld Cone, Waiau and Eltham in the South Island have been affected. People should text rather than call if possible, it said. Power went out in many areas including Picton, Blenheim and Havelock. Lansdowne Park in Blenheim was also closed due to liquefaction. Several multi-story buildings received damage - both internally and structurally - and glass fell into streets. Power was out in some areas, and Civil Defence controller Bruce Pepperell said early indications were that a number of major buildings showed signs of structural stress and the strong quake would likely have caused a mess inside. Mr Pepperell said the capital's suburban rail network would not be operating until further notice, while rail tracks, bridges and tunnels were checked. Buses were unlikely to replace the trains. He said 25 buildings in the CBD had so far been identified as having suffered potential structural damage. The damage had been referred to building owners for detailed examination by engineers, Mr Pepperell said. Some city streets were showered with broken glass during the quake and it was feared strong winds tonight could dislodge more glass. Land movement of up to 1m has been reported on reclaimed land on the waterfront with large cracks opening up in concreted areas. Wellington Harbour Master Mike Pryce said he and port operator CentrePort were still assessing the earthquake damage to the waterfront including liquefaction. CentrePort said it would issue an update on the situation shortly. Cheers for the concern all, everyone's ok. People who left their homes in the city centre were told they could find temporary refuge at the BizDojo Centre on 115 Tory Street, or Houghton Valley School further out of the city. Residents in coastal areas were urged to stay inland or on high ground. Affected spots include seaside areas of Wellington's south coast, Seatoun and Eastbourne. Civil Defence in Otago said the land-based threat to the eastern coasts had passed and people were being allowed to go home. The controller for Clutha district, Charles Hakkaart, said the main evacuations were in low-lying houses in Pounawea, Taieri Mouth and Toko Mouth. The quake struck near Hanmer Springs Photo: Supplied Chatham Islands About 40 people were evacuated from their homes on the Chatham Islands, mainly in the settlement of Kaingaroa, and more made their own way to higher ground. Chatham Islands mayor Alfred Priest said the island was the path for tsunamis from both New Zealand and South America, and locals were good at responding to the threats."}

The first event, a 7.8-magnitude quake, struck just after midnight Monday near the coastal community of Kaikoura, some 93 kilometers (55 miles) northeast of the city of Christchurch, the US Geological Survey reported. It triggered waves of 2.49 meters (8 feet) above usual tide levels, the highest he has seen in his 38 years in New Zealand, Philip Duncan of Weather Watch New Zealand said. A 6.2-magnitude quake struck around 1:30 p.m. 39 kilometers west-southwest of Kaikoura, further north of Christchurch.

WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND - NOVEMBER 14: Glass and rubble covers the footpath on Wakefield Street after an earthquake on November 14, 2016 in Wellington, New Zealand. The 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck 20km south-east of Hanmer Springs at 12.02am and triggered tsunami warnings for many coastal areas. The 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck 20km south-east of Hanmer Springs at 12.02am and triggered tsunami warnings for many coastal areas. Near the epicenter, it opened up snaking fissures in roads and triggered landslides. It caused damage in Wellington, the capital, more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the north and was also strongly felt in the city of Christchurch to the south. Residents said the shaking went on for about three minutes, and was followed by a number of strong aftershocks. Police said one person died in the small coastal town of Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. The quake completely cut off road access to Kaikoura, said resident Terry Thompson, who added that electricity and most phones were also down in the town of 2,000, a popular destination for tourists taking part in whale-watching expeditions. Thompson was out of town but managed to reach his wife by cellphone during the night before her phone died. His wife helped a 93-year-old neighbor and a tourist into her car and drove to higher ground, he said. Prime Minister John Key said waves of about 2 meters (6.6 feet) hit the coast but the tsunami threat had since been downgraded to coastal warnings. He said authorities had no reason to believe the death toll would rise above the two reported fatalities. In Wellington, it collapsed a ferry loading ramp, broke windows and caused items to fall from shelves. It also forced hundreds of tourists onto the streets as hotels were evacuated. Authorities in Wellington were urging people who work in the center of the city to stay home on Monday. City officials said that some large buildings were showing signs of structural stress, and the quake would likely have caused a mess in some buildings. earthquake that struck Christchurch in 2011, destroying much of the downtown area and killing 185 people.

Upstairs, her mother let out a scream. The 24-year-old is accustomed to quakes in the temblor-prone region, so she said she sat calmly and waited, figuring the rumbling would stop in a few seconds. The quake was far less violent than the one that struck Christchurch in 2011, Gin said, adding that there was no jarring up and down or side to side, just a long, rolling sensation. But it went on for much longer than the typical quakes that strike the area, she said. She was less concerned about running for cover than she was about vomiting from the motion sickness, she said. She said her house, which was damaged in the 2011 quake, did not appear to have sustained any new damage Monday. She also said she had heard from many of her friends who live in the city, and all were safe. The quake was centered 93 kilometers (57 miles) northeast of Christchurch, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The USGS initially estimated it had a magnitude of 7.4 before revising it to 7.8. It said the quake struck at a depth of 23 kilometers (14 miles), after initially putting the depth at 10 kilometers (six miles).

Most earthquakes occur at faults, which are breaks extending deep within the earth, caused by movements of these plates. There are thousands of earthquakes in New Zealand every year, but most of them are not felt because they are either small, or very deep within the earth. A large, damaging earthquake could occur at any time, and can be followed by aftershocks that continue for days or weeks. Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths result from falling debris, flying glass and collapsing structures such as buildings and bridges. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires and tsunami. BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE Getting ready before an earthquake strikes will help reduce damage to your home and business and help you survive. Develop a Household Emergency Plan. Assemble and maintain your emergency survival Items for your home and workplace, as well as a portable getaway kit. Practice Drop, Cover and Hold. Identify safe places within your home, school or workplace. See the right-hand panel for more information about safe places. Check your household insurance policy for cover and amount. Seek qualified advice to make sure your house is secured to its foundations and ensure any renovations comply with the New Zealand Building Code. Secure heavy items of furniture to the floor or wall. Visit www.eqc.govt.nz to find out how to quake-safe your home. DURING AN EARTHQUAKE If you are inside a building, move no more than a few steps, drop, cover and hold. Stay indoors till the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit. In most buildings in New Zealand you are safer if you stay where you are until the shaking stops. If you are in an elevator, drop, cover and hold. When the shaking stops, try and get out at the nearest floor if you can safely do so. If you are outdoors when the shaking starts, move no more than a few steps away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and power lines, then Drop, Cover and Hold. If you are at the beach or near the coast, drop, cover and hold then move to higher ground immediately in case a tsunami follows the quake. If you are driving, pull over to a clear location, stop and stay there with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops. Once the shaking stops, proceed with caution and avoid bridges or ramps that might have been damaged. If you are in a mountainous area or near unstable slopes or cliffs, be alert for falling debris or landslides. AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE Listen to your local radio stations as emergency management officials will be broadcasting the most appropriate advice for your community and situation. Expect to feel aftershocks. Check yourself for injuries and get first aid if necessary. Help others if you can. Be aware that electricity supply could be cut, and fire alarms and sprinkler systems can go off in buildings during an earthquake even if there is no fire. Check for, and extinguish, small fires. If you are in a damaged building, try to get outside and find a safe, open place. Use the stairs, not the elevators. Watch out for fallen power lines or broken gas lines, and stay out of damaged areas. Only use the phone for short essential calls to keep the lines clear for emergency calls. If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window, get everyone out quickly and turn off the gas if you can. If you see sparks, broken wires or evidence of electrical system damage, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box if it is safe to do so. Keep your animals under your direct control as they can become disorientated. Take measures to protect your animals from hazards, and to protect other people from your animals. If your property is damaged, take notes and photographs for insurance purposes. If you rent your property, contact your landlord and your contents insurance company as soon as possible. HOW TO GET READY Household Emergency Plan Emergency Survival Items Evacuation People with disabilities Pets and livestock How to store water Emergency Sanitation Get your car ready Get your business ready Radio stations to listen to SAFE PLACES IN AN EARTHQUAKE Somewhere close to you, no more than a few steps or less than three metres away, to avoid injury from flying debris. Under a strong table. Hold on to the table legs to keep it from moving away from you. Next to an interior wall, away from windows that can shatter and cause injury and tall furniture that can fall on you. Protect your head and neck with your arms. Keep in mind that in modern homes, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the structure and usually have doors that can swing and injure you. DROP, COVER, HOLD DISCREDITED EARTHQUAKE SAFETY INFORMATION You will find other information (not Drop, Cover and Hold) on the Internet about what to do in an earthquake. Much of it has been discredited, and should not be followed. Research from the United States, Taiwan, Japan and Christchurch (all places with modern, earthquake resistant building design codes), supports and recommends the core message for New Zealand: Drop, Cover and Hold is the right action to take in an earthquake."}

Most of the buzz is swirling around a rumoured iPhone that is supposed to boast a 6.5-inch OLED screen, up from 5.8 inches on the existing iPhone X. OLED is a step up from traditional LCD technology in offering a display without a backlight, so black is truly black rather than simply dark. If the speculation pans out, the even-bigger iPhone would represent Apple's attempt to feed consumers' appetite for increasingly bigger screens as they rely on smartphones to watch and record video, as well as take photos wherever they are. The iPhone X, a dramatically redesigned model released last fall, got rid of the home button and introduced facial-recognition technology to unlock the device. Although the iPhone X didn't fulfill analysts' lofty sales expectations, it fared well enough for Apple to up the ante with the bigger model, whose price is expected to unveil Wednesday. Apple also is expected to release an iPhone with minor updates to last year's model and another version made of cheaper materials, including a 6.1-inch LCD screen. The cheaper phone also is expected to lose the home button. Price cuts for older models, with the home button, are also likely. Names for the new devices aren't known. The company may also announce a new smartwatch. Apple didn't comment ahead of Wednesday's event, which is being held at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. By making more expensive iPhones, Apple has been able to boost its profits despite waning demand as people upgrade phones less frequently. During the second quarter, which is typically slow for Apple, China's Huawei Technologies surpassed Apple as the second-largest seller of smartphones, based on Gartner's calculations. Samsung remained in the lead. A man holds an iPhone mobile phone handset.

Mr Brownlee says he was just doing his job raising questions about the class action with a law firm, prompted by a letter placed in the mailboxes of his constituents. Ms Thorn said at the end of the call the man identified himself as National MP Gerry Brownlee. His call was prompted by a letter encouraging owners of new Christchurch builds to allow the law firm to investigate if they have non-compliant steel in their homes, after three mesh companies were found guilty of selling the product. The law firm used a public relations company to complain to National leader Simon Bridges' office about the call and are awaiting a response. He spoke to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee about his goal to visit his brother and friend overseas while he was still in good health. For more on this story, watch 1 NEWS at 6pm.

Gin, a 24-year-old lifelong Christchurch resident, is accustomed to quakes, so she said she sat calmly and waited, figuring the rumbling would stop in a few seconds. Instead, the shaking just went on and on - for at least three minutes, according to the clock on her phone, she said by phone. The quake was far less violent than the one that struck her city in 2011, Gin said, adding that there was no jarring up and down or side to side, just a long, rolling sensation. But it went on for much longer than the typical quakes that strike the area, she said. She was less concerned about running for cover than she was about vomiting from the motion sickness, she said with a chuckle. She said she had heard from many of her friends who live in the city, and all were safe. A 2011 earthquake in the city of Christchurch destroyed much of the downtown and killed 185 people.

Wairarapa earthquake. In a matter of seconds the New Zealand landscape changed forever. Shore platforms along the coast were uplifted, landslides blocked rivers and roads, and large intermittent surface ruptures extended for over 120 km. The Kaikoura earthquake cause extensive surface rupture over a distance of over 120 km. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Kate Pedley, University of Canterbury) In the aftermath of the quake, scientists scrambled to not only figure out which faults ruptured, but how at least 9 different faults could rupture simultaneously. Additionally, because of the incredible surface traces and landslides, this earthquake provided an opportunity to document an earthquake better than ever before. Thanks to Dr. Kate Pedley, a lecturer at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, we are able to share some of the incredible imagery captured following the November 14th quake. This large landslide caused by the Kaikoura earthquake created both incredible surface features, and a significant dams. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Kate Pedley, University of Canterbury) The Kaikoura earthquake caused extremely complex surface ruptures to form on at least 9 different faults. This image was taken to the north of the fault scarp shown in the first image. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Kate Pedley, University of Canterbury) Several massive landslide dams were caused by the Kaikoura earthquake. In this case. the Leader River was blocked, leading to the formation of Lake Rebekah. Landslide dams can be a threat to people since they can fail catastrophically. By doing this, they could create the most comprehensive dataset of any fault rupture. This earthquake not only provides an opportunity for stunning documentation, but raises several questions. Scientists do know that they merge with the Alpine Fault to the southwest, but their interaction at depth is less known. Using the finite fault model produced by the USGS, we can at least gauge if merging the faults at depth is plausible. In the model, the failure structure in the November 14th event had a dip of 38 degrees to the northwest, and ruptured at a depth of 22 km. Based on the strike of this structure and the surface traces of the faults which ruptured, intersection would take place at a minimum depth of 18-28 km. While this number could fluctuate based on fault dip at depth, it does at least suggest that a large, singular structure could be the reason why so many faults ruptured. However, additional research and data is required to verify this finding. One of the principle reasons why determining the rupture dynamics in this earthquake is important is because it could improving our understanding of hazards associated with large-scale fault systems, and how faults can interact with one another. The video below shows GNS scientist Kelvin Berryman explaining the fault rupture on the Papatea Fault."}

Home to about 2,000 residents, Kaikoura is a popular destination for travelers taking part in whale-watching expeditions or wanting a stopover with mountain views. But the quake knocked out water supplies and sewerage systems and left people with no easy way out. Webb said the military planned to begin using four NH90 helicopters on Tuesday that could each transport about 18 people out of the town at a time. He said a ship was also leaving Auckland on Monday night that could potentially pick up hundreds of people if weather conditions allowed. He said that if needed, a C-130 military transport plane could drop fuel, water, food and other supplies to the town. Elsewhere, strong aftershocks continued to shake New Zealand on Monday, rattling the nerves of exhausted residents. The country was largely spared the devastation it saw in 2011 when an earthquake struck the city of Christchurch and killed 185 people. Residents said the shaking went on for about three minutes. Police said one person died in Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Several other people suffered minor injuries in Kaikoura, police spokeswoman Rachel Purdom said. Prime Minister John Key flew over the destruction in Kaikoura by helicopter as aftershocks kicked up dust from the landslides below. Cars could be seen lying on their sides and parts of the road were clearly impassable. He later toured the area and met with locals. He estimated the cleanup effort would run into the billions of dollars and said clearing the debris and blocked roads could take months. Kaikoura resident Terry Thompson said he was out of town when the quake struck but managed to reach his wife on her cellphone before the phone died. Thompson said his wife helped a 93-year-old neighbor and a tourist into her car and drove to higher ground. Video taken from a helicopter near Kaikoura showed three cows stranded on an island of grass in a paddock that had been ripped apart in the quake. The patch of grass was surrounded by deep ravines of collapsed earth, trapping the animals where they stood. In Wellington, it collapsed a ferry loading ramp, broke windows and caused items to fall from shelves. It also forced hundreds of tourists onto the streets as hotels were evacuated. Australians Paul and Sandra Wardrop and their children, Alexander, 15, and William, 12, were on the 10th floor of the Park Hotel when the shaking began. Police, meanwhile, stepped up their patrols after receiving several reports of burglaries in homes and businesses that had been evacuated due to the quake. Officials said some large buildings were showing signs of structural stress. The 2011 quake was located almost directly beneath Christchurch, meaning tens of thousands of people were exposed to the most violent shaking at the epicenter. The quake was centered 93 kilometers (57 miles) northeast of Christchurch at a depth of 23 kilometers (14 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The final published paper will be available online from November at www.earthquakespectra.org. By Ann Brower for Star.Kiwi At 12:51pm on 22 February 2011, 12 people died beside me. The parapet and facade of an unreinforced masonry building on the main street of Christchurch, New Zealand, crushed the bus that I was riding. I'm the only one left, the lucky 13th. My leg, my hand, and my soul will never be the same. I broke more bones than the surgeons were willing to count, spent two months in hospital, and most of a year off work. I walked, slept, and dreamed in a fog for four years. It cost half a million dollars to save my left leg. I treasure that leg, scars and all, but still feel the earthquake in every step. In this article, I share my story - from the earthquake, to the Bright Light, to the Dark Place, to the hospital, to the Dalai Lama, to the halls of Parliament. I also share the story of a nation coming to grips with its home on the Ring of Fire. I conclude with the lessons I've learned on making a difference. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Introduction Ann Brower was the sole survivor of 13 people who were crushed in a bus on Colombo St during the February 22 earthquake. It's less normal to feel brick after brick land on your left hip, and wonder how long you'll last. It's most unusual to be dug out from under a collapsed building by strangers, and taken to hospital in the back of another stranger's truck. It's decidedly abnormal to plead with those strangers who are risking their lives to save yours to get the others first, only to find out that there are no others. It's extraordinary to discover you're the only one left. Such an experience tends to be life-changing. It changed me from an economically-oriented political scientist focused on land and the environment into a reluctant activist for science-informed law reform of unreinforced masonry buildings in New Zealand. Before the earthquakes, as a Fulbright scholar with a newly-minted Berkeley PhD, I had accidentally instigated a science-informed national land law reform in New Zealand (Brower 2008). So I had a few tricks up my sleeve, ready for action on building safety. I was also not alone. Engineers, geologists, and others renewed and amplified calls to acknowledge the island nation's home on the Ring of Fire. In this article I share our story - from earthquake to Building Act - and conclude with some lessons from Christchurch on making a difference. The story begins while reading The Economist on a bus on the main street of Christchurch, New Zealand. Before the quakes, Colombo Street looked like any other main street in NZ. It was full of precariously perched parapets, loosely tied awnings, and blissfully unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, of which there are thousands across New Zealand (Russell and Ingham 2010; GNS Science 2014), Oregon (Paxton et al 2015), Washington state (Gilbert 2016), British Columbia (Paxton et al 2017), and even California (Paxton et al 2015), and beyond. URM buildings did not fare well in Christchurch (Moon et al. 2014). Those of us next to these buildings fared even worse (Giaretton et al 2016). Sixteen people died and one person was paralysed on one block of Colombo Street, the main street of Christchurch. Twelve people died on or beside a red bus travelling from my seaside village of Sumner (Figures 1, 2). I was the lucky one. It only took me 2 months to get home, and another 18 months to get back to running, jumping, and playing the fiddle. The earthquake is an indelible part of my left leg, and of my life story. Part 1: From the earthquake to the Dark Place The bus stops, jumps in an aftershock. I look up from The Economist. I look out the window, see bricks fall. This is definitively no longer cool. I see buildings all along the other side of the street crumble. I hear buildings on our side explode into the street, ejecting bits onto the footpath, into the street, and onto our bus. Bricks hit bus. One by one, by 10, by 50, by 100. They stop. They start again. No. Not bricks, chunks. Windows. Bus seats. The sounds stop. I don't hear chunks, I feel them. On my left hip. Chunks don't clatter or clunk. They push. They press. They crush. The bus roof and my left hip fuse, become one. Pelvis breaks. More than once. All sounds, all scents, all colours fuse. Pain. Lights. Flashes. Bright Light. I float. I watch. No. This is not my life. This is not me. This is not an acceptable situation. I am not OK with this. This is not my story. No. Bright Light fades. Dark Place arrives. Part 2: From Dark Place to first surgery In the Dark Place, I feel the involuntary death throes of a 14 year old boy, a 78 year old woman, and 10 others in between. My leg, my hand, and my soul will never be the same. When I enter the Dark Place, I do what any rational person would do. I scream at the top of my lungs. A sizeable gang of kind souls have already started clearing the rubble off the collapsed roof of the bus. When I scream, they stop. Ann Brower being rushed to hospital after being freed. It also attracts Rick and Paddy, an ex-cop and a tunnellist, to the rescue effort. Rick heard it from 2 blocks away. The gang quickly sends down an emissary to ever so politely ask me to please shut up. That's when Mike appears outside my window. And they did. None of my rescuers was a professional first-responder. But they did an extraordinary thing that day. Doug and the gang dug a meter of bricks and concrete off the collapsed roof of the bus and ripped the roof off with their bare hands. Rick and Paddy crawled into the bus, and freed my left leg from the bus seat that was crushing it. They lifted me through a broken window. Scotty held my hand as I lay in the middle of Colombo Street. Josie splinted my left leg. Garry flagged down a truck, convinced the driver to take us to hospital, parted the already gridlocked traffic, told me jokes and stories, and delivered me to hospital. Garry stayed with me in the Emergency Department for hours, through aftershocks, sirens, power outages, and the reassuring calm of the doctors and nurses. I nearly broke his hand when they reset my leg. When the hospital kicked Garry out, he gave careful hand-holding instructions to a medical student, Adele, who stayed as I floated into and out of shock. She took me up on the bet that my leg wasn't broken. I lost. When surgeons took me away, she went home to check on her flatmates. The rest of Christchurch had to wait for Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) to mobilize from all round the world. I had my very own Ann Search and Rescue, or ASAR for short. During two months in hospital, nearly every member of ASAR came to visit. For some it was as much for them as for me - in the hopes of easing the night sweats and incessant replays. Two sent their mums to visit, with brownies. In August 2011, I hired a band and a pub, and threw a Rescue Party to celebrate the kindness of friend and stranger. Despite the cold winter rain and All Blacks-Wallabies match on that night, a festive crowd including many of my rescuers, nurses, and physios turned up. A good time was had by all. And we mustn't forget Rob. As the others were clearing the rubble, he crawled into the bus and took it upon himself to hold my hand. The dark shadows in his bright blue eyes told me in no uncertain terms that I mustn't look around me. So I didn't. I looked only at Rob, who had somehow crawled into my small pocket of crushed-ness.

So he told me his favorite fishing stories while we waited to be dug out. When Rob grabbed my hand, I went from being crushed, trapped and alone, to just being crushed and trapped. It's an incredible gift they gave. When I think back to the earthquake, I do not see the horrors of Colombo Street. All I see is my rescuers. And I smile. It's a wet and salty smile, but a smile all the same. Part 3: The Dalai Lama Less than a week after getting off crutches in June 2011, I received a text message from the hospital. His Holiness the Dalai Lama was requesting the honor of my company in Ward 20 of Christchurch Hospital at 2pm that afternoon. I skipped physio that day. The Dalai Lama's visit helped me and five other seriously injured survivors start to make peace with the pain. Three were in wheelchairs, one was still on bedrest. His Holiness told us to let go of the shoulda-woulda-couldas that haunt survivors. The point isn't that we could've died; it's that we didn't. Strongly and gently, the Dalai Lama empowered us to give something to the world. We all had something, he assured us, but we needed to traverse the pain and anger. If we allowed the pain to become part of us, the anger would subside. That would leave room to each give our something to the world. Part 4: Royal Commission Inquiries Also in 2011, the government commissioned a Royal Commission of Inquiry into building performance in the Canterbury earthquakes (CERC 2011). I was invited, but not required to testify. In preparing to testify, it became clear to me that the thirteen of us who were crushed suffered not from a sin of commission, but from manifold sins of omission. In reading the evidence about the building that collapsed onto our bus, it was hard to avoid the conclusion that Parliament, the building owners, and the City Council had, each in their own way, left us there to die. The dark shadows in his bright blue eyes told me in no uncertain terms that I mustn't look around me. So I didn't. I looked only at Rob, who had somehow crawled into my small pocket of crushed-ness. SHARE THIS QUOTE: Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Show more Share on Facebook facebook Share on Twitter twitter Share via email email Share on LinkedIn linkedin Share on Google Plus google-plus Share on Whatsapp whatsapp Share on Pinterest pinterest Share on Reddit reddit The six-inch pile of evidence compiled by the Royal Commission made it searingly obvious that there was nothing natural about the disaster that befell the thirteen of us. It wasn't the earthquake. It was the building, decisions made about the building, and the failure to enforce those decisions. At the time, the newspapers were saying we should label unsafe buildings, to let the market squeeze them out of existence or into compliance. I'd seen such plaques in California, and watched as they were politely hidden and universally ignored. Market-induced voluntary compliance would have done nothing to protect us because most of those killed and injured by brick buildings were on the footpath or in the street. All of my training in public policy told me that this is precisely the type of market failure where central government should step in. In the Royal Commission hearings, the owner of each building that caused death testified. The building that collapsed on us was divided into 4 addresses, owned by 2 owners. The owner of the 4th address strapped his building after September. Bits of it fell onto another bus, but no one was hurt. At the tea break in the hearings, the families of the dead and I could not contain our rage. If anyone had had the courage to require tie-backs, not just encourage them, many of the 12 who died beside me might still be alive. Being a numbers type, I went straight home and issued an Official Information Act request to the national health service asking about my medical expenses. Approximately. This 3rd recommendation was already a watering-down of engineering advice to the Commission. During the Royal Commission hearings, many of us had begun a journey of trying to inspire a policy change. The team, loosely organized at best, comprised engineers, geologists, families of the dead, and me. Perhaps not surprisingly, I started my journey from a place of anger for those who died beside me, sorrow for my own pain, and terror of brick buildings. I expressed that raw anger in newspaper opinion pieces calling URM more risky than valuable (Brower 2013), and decrying the city council for failing to secure falling hazards before re-opening the city streets after September. The day after the Royal Commission published its recommendations, the Government issued its proposed changes to the Building Act (MBIE 2013). To my eyes, of the three main recommendations about URM, the government proposed to do 1 and 2, but not 3. I felt ill for a day. I had no place in the world; and the world had no place in me. Part 6: Parliamentary hearings, round one As the proposals continued towards Parliament, I replaced the anger with pragmatism and efficiency. In other words, I forced my angry heart to step back and let my science-informed-policy head take over. I looked again at the Royal Commission's research (Ingham and Griffith 2011a,b) and recommendations (CERC 2012). Following their lead, I started to soften my stance. To acknowledge our seismicity, NZ should prioritise fixing the riskiest bits of the most exposed buildings. Allowing falling hazards to remain unattached was inadvertently using NZ's public health system to subsidise building owners. In New Zealand, the public is invited to submit our ideas on proposed government policies at least twice - when the Ministry publishes a proposal, and then when the Parliamentary Select Committee considers draft legislation. NZ's Ministry for Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) handles the buildings portfolio. Currently the Minister for Building and Housing is the Honourable Dr Nick Smith, who is also Minister for the Environment (see Part 7). In October 2013, USGS and its NZ equivalent GNS Science, invited me on a study tour of American cities with under-appreciated seismic risk - Seattle, Memphis, Charleston, and Washington, DC. I used it as a crash course in structural engineering, seismology, and risk. It also served as a team-building event for those of us quietly advocating seismic retrofitting. So I combined what economic data I could gather with what I had learned on the study tour to write the best submission to Parliament that I could. I heeded Olshansky's (2005) lessons of offering clear solutions to identified problems to an appropriate audience within an optimal window of opportunity. I noted that the Ministry's research on earthquake-prone buildings paid close attention to (1) the cost of retrofitting, borne by building owners. It paid less close attention to (2) the cost of failing to retrofit, borne by the public. It paid no attention to (3) the value of the buildings in question (MBIE 2013). So I used government property valuations to re-frame the question from the costs of retrofitting to the costs of failing to retrofit URM buildings (Table A2, Appendix 1). Much of the modern scholarship on good governance and science-informed policy states or implies that governments should aim for the 3 Es - efficiency, effectiveness, and equity (Andrews and Entwistle 2010). I added 3 more Es - using economics to talk about efficiency, engineering to talk about effectiveness, and emotion to talk about equity (Brower 2014). I used the three additional Es and the aforementioned tricks up my sleeve to be strategic. In public policy classes at Berkeley, they taught us never to fear speaking truth to power. But they also taught us to be cunning. Though I tried to ground my submission in cold hard logic, I did not shy away from pulling at heartstrings. I was not alone in this. Parliament received many other submissions supporting strengthening from many quarters: 24 community groups, 40 local and central government agencies, 17 engineering and geology firms or organisations, and 28 individuals. They also received submissions opposing further regulation, including 4 building owners' collectives and 5 businesses. Further, many of my rescuers on Colombo Street were engineers and builders. Many of them knew and shared my passion for changing the law. Many engineering firms and the professional associations of earthquake engineers were preparing submissions, and many shared my interest in prioritizing URM. So several of my rescuers who worked for engineering firms asked if their firms could use parts of my submission in theirs. The city of Christchurch also asked. Given the contested political landscape, I shared my submission early and often with anyone who asked and even many who didn't (Brower 2013a,b; 2015a,c,d). In New Zealand, anyone who submits to Parliament can speak their mind, in five minutes or less. For my five minutes, I used cold-hearted political strategy thinly wrapped in emotion. I told the Parliamentary Committee that I did not envy their task. They would hear lots from the economic interest of building owners, but the voices for public safety will always be quieter (Wilson 1989; Olson 1965). They were not likely to hear from many of the victims of the quake because being crushed by a building is not an empowering experience; it doesn't do wonders for the confidence. The voices of the dead and injured would be quiet at best. So I pleaded with the Committee to listen to the voices that they will never hear, and to hear those who have no voice. Sometimes, those least able to speak have the most to say. When the Select Committee reported out the changes they'd made to the Bill in the autumn of 2014, there was still no special provision for URM and falling hazards like parapets. I first heard about it from a reporter, as I was walking in the sharply volcanic hills above Lyttelton Harbour where I live. Part 7: Parliamentary hearings, round two The following week, there was an earthquake in Dunedin, about five hours south of Christchurch. Two of my colleagues at university told me I simply must write another opinion piece. So I did (Brower 2015a). New Zealand being a small country, I bumped into my local Member of Parliament (MP) at the farmers market that weekend. She had read my opinion piece. She told me in no uncertain terms that I must send that opinion piece to Clayton (another Christchurch MP). If you've ever met the Honourable Ruth Dyson, you will know that she is not to be disobeyed. So I sent it. On Tuesday, the Select Committee announced another round of submissions, hearings, and consideration. Having taught a first year undergraduate course about NZ Government to undergraduates for years, I knew this was rare for Parliament. The only people who could submit in the second round were those who had submitted in the first round. Again, our loose national team of engineers, geologists, and others advocating seismic upgrades worked together on submissions. We all drilled in on our most important points, while applying them to the changes already proposed. This time I tried to push emotion to the side, and focus on pragmatism. In looking at the benefits of reinforcing masonry (Ingham and Griffith 2011b), I marveled that a safety conscious and fiscally conservative centre-right government would do anything other than fix the most dangerous bits first and leave the rest for later (Brower 2015b). The second round of Select Committee hearings fell right in the middle of the university semester when I teach first-year Introduction to Government. We have MPs from all seven parties in Parliament give guest lectures. Many of the local MPs were on the Select Committee considering the Building Act amendments. So following Riker (1986), I abused my access and asked each and every one what was happening behind-the-scenes. They said the opposition parties were very much on the side of prioritizing URM and falling hazards, but the Minister wouldn't move. In NZ, if the Minister won't move, his party colleagues can't either. So once again I spoke to the Select Committee for five minutes, by phone this time, between classes. I crossed my fingers, but did not hold my breath. Part 8: Five minutes with the Minister A month later, and two weeks before the Select Committee was due to report out a second time, I got a phone call from a business reporter at the National Business Review (NBR) weekly newspaper. She was all fired up, and had been writing a series of articles about the Building Act saga. With a speck of hope, I rang a friend in Wellington to see if the Minister was coming round to our side following NBR pressure. Not a chance, he said. With a slightly bruised speck of hope, I noticed that the Minister of Building, Housing, and Environment was to speak at an environmental conference in Auckland the following Friday. New Zealand being small, I was to speak at the same conference. It was a snowy August weekend and I had no plans. So I dusted the bruises off the speck of hope, and wrote one last opinion piece. I said the same thing that I and many others had said many times before, in slightly different words. Both Christchurch's The Press and Auckland's NZ Herald published it two days before the conference (Brower 2015a,b). I knew the Minister's private secretary for environment from previous work on the land law reforms. So at the conference, I asked for five minutes with the Minister. I got my five minutes. The Minister empathized with the idea of equity, he said. Parapets are a danger to those outside, not inside; and that's not fair. The following week, I got a call from the Minister's private secretary for buildings. He told me about the changes he had made to the bill. He had halved the required time for fixing parapets and other URM falling hazards in the high and medium seismic zones of the country. I hadn't got all I wanted, but I had got most. So I invited a couple of my rescuers to join me, to meet the Minister and announce the changes (Smith 2015; Otago Daily Times 2015). I had to miss an hour of class. After festering for years with neither cross-party nor public support, the changes from both rounds of Select Committee hearings transformed a contentious bill to one that passed 120-1. MPs who spoke to the Bill were visibly proud to work together and listen to the public they serve and the scientists they fund. During the Parliamentary dinner break, the Minister bought me dinner in the Beehive cafeteria. We had sticky date pudding for dessert, just to celebrate. Part 9: Larger policy questions It is easy to say that since 13 of us were crushed by a building, that building should have been fixed. It is much more difficult to know whether the new Building Act would have prevented all of the deaths in the streets due to falling masonry. If all of the following were true, then fewer facades and parapets would have fallen on people and vehicles: 1) the next earthquake had waited for the allowed remediation time to pass; 2) the central government had enforced the inspection timeframes on councils; 3) local councils had rigourously enforced the remediation timeframes on owners; 4) owners could organize finance and repairs within the timeframe; 5) there are enough qualified engineers and builders in NZ to carry out the inspections and repairs; 6) all the repairs were done well. Indeed in January 2017, central government decided to mitigate items 1-4 by drastically shortening the remediation timeframe to 12 months and subsidizing repairs on URM buildings (Beehive 2017; MBIE 2017) within the Kaikoura M7.8 (14 November 2016) aftershock zone (Bradley et al 2017: p. 7), which contains the nation's capital of Wellington. Hindsight aside, there are economic reasons why buildings like the one that crushed the 13 of us had not been fixed. And there are political reasons why URM buildings are often left out of modern building codes (Olshansky 2005). In 2011, New Zealand had thousands of URM and other earthquake-prone buildings, many in struggling provincial towns with low building values. As Tables A1 and A2 in Appendix 1 suggest, full retrofits might not make sense if the costs exceed the value of the building. There are a few ways to think about how much of whose money to spend fixing which parts of what buildings. At the centre of such questions are considerations of public vs. private in risks, costs, and benefits. One idea is to prioritise public benefit from culturally significant buildings. We could ask local councils to identify the most culturally significant heritage buildings, subsidise their retrofits, remove the heritage status from the less outstanding buildings, and make it easier to remove falling hazards (or entire buildings) previously protected with heritage status (Crampton and Meade 2016). Another idea is to prioritise mitigating public risk. Parapets and other URM falling hazards are a public problem because the public bears the physical risk as parapets and facades pose a threat to passers-by more than inhabitants. Under NZ's accident insurance scheme, public also bears the financial risk because the government absorbs all liability, no matter who is at fault. Owners of falling hazards thus receive an indirect subsidy. This can create a moral hazard, unwittingly encouraging risk by cheaply insuring against it. If there are to be subsidies, it is better to subsidise safety than risk. If there are not subsidies, then a national standard that prioritises fixing the most dangerous bits first and leaving the rest for later is another way to allocate limited resources efficiently, effectively, and equitably. But extraordinary events can change ordinary life plans. I share the lessons I've learned on how the Little Guy can make a difference Lessons from Christchurch on Making a Difference Politics is an exercise in strategic hypocrisy. Choose your battles. The Little Guy can make a change, sometimes. What happens after the change is up to the public. If we revert to apathy, old patterns re-emerge. Write your point clearly, and share it. Early and often. To make a change, carefully seek and forcefully proclaim the truth as you see it. And never, ever, ever give up. Politics is a team sport. Catalysts do achieve change But almost never alone Politics is an exercise in strategic hypocrisy. Don't be afraid to change your position if it becomes necessary. And don't be afraid to state things a bit too confidently or a bit too simply. In my successive newspaper opinion pieces, I changed both tone and message radically. I started with angry absolutism and ended with cold pragmatism. Similar to Olshansky's (2005) findings, the more pragmatic the solution offered, the more positive the response I received. Decisions are often not rational, and they often ignore technical advice (Stone 2001). Knowing that, as professionals interested in seismic preparedness, you've got to choose your battles carefully. There's an optimum ratio between sleeping, trying, and failing. The battles you need to fight are those where you can't count on sleeping if you failed to try. There's a big difference between trying but failing, and failing to try. Ability to sleep lies in the balance. In the 11th hour of the Building Act saga, I learned that the Little Guy can make a difference and MPs do listen, sometimes. But we Little Guys must team up, and play all the cards we've got very strategically (Pralle 2006). Previous experience had taught me that we Little Guys have to remain vigilant even after a change occurs. If we spend too much time with the champagne after our victories, old patterns re-emerge (Brower 2008). If we Little Guys stop watching, we allow the Powers that Be to give the rhetoric to one side but the victory to the other (Edelman 1960). In other words, if we don't participate actively in the implementation of NZ's new Building Act, the rhetoric might favour safety while the decisions on individual buildings favour letting it slide. This is neither conspiracy nor government malfeasance, just power imbalances. The decks are stacked against public interest groups. The economic interests behind the desire to avoid retrofitting will usually be stronger than the public interest behind the desire for safety (Olson 1965). It can feel uncomfortable purporting to know The Way Forward for The Nation. To me, it felt arrogant and presumptuous. But when other people imposed their will, I realized it was well within my rights to do the same. In the end, it's up to Parliament to decide. All I did was ask Parliament to consider a few things. People often say that politics is a game, and it should get out of the way of rational decisions. But politics never gets out of the way (Stone 2001). For engineers, geologists, and other earthquake professionals reading Earthquake Spectra, it's worth considering whether activism in some form is part of what you signed up for (Olshansky 2005; Porter 2016). In other words, earthquake preparedness at its best is more about people than models. Conclusion You might wish to take this as a Call to Arms. I will leave that up to you. But I will say that you create your world. Others will try to shape the world according to their vision. So it is your right, and perhaps your responsibility, to at least try to shape your world to your vision. Trying but failing is better than failing to try. I have no wish to tell you what your vision for the world should be, but I hope the lessons I've shared might help you to realise it. In realizing your vision, consider taking a page from Margaret Mead.

New Zealand. Aztec inspired motifs on an Art Deco building erected after the 1931 earthquake. Edward Gibbon Wakefield established the New Zealand Company to settle the land in 1839 just after the establishment of SA. He began his settlements in Wellington with his brother in charge, followed by later settlements in Whanganui, New Plymouth and Nelson. He also established the Canterbury Association with Robert Godley for the settlement of Christchurch in 1848. NZ was established as a serious of very separate settlements and the major cities of NZ today reflect that early history. His original Wellington settlement covered the area from Wellington to Napier and Hastings. Napier was a favoured spot in the Hawkes Bay region (named by Captain Cook in 1769) as it had a good port. The Crown purchased land from the Maoris in 1851 in Hawkes Bay. Before this purchase in 1851 William Colenso, a Cornishman had established a mission station here to work with the Maori in 1844. He was dismissed from the Missionary Society in 1852 as he had fathered a child with their Maori maid in 1850.His wife separated from him in 1853 but they never divorced. Colenso stayed on as a settler in Hawkes Bay. He became a MP for Napier in the national parliament in 1861. The illegitimate son Wiremu left NZ when he grew up and returned to live in Cornwall. A few settlers began to arrive in Hawks Bay around 1852 and in 1854 a town named Napier was laid out. It was named after Sir Charles Napier the British Army Commander in Chief in India who had died in 1853. As more settlers came to Hawkes Bay in the mid-1850s a public meeting in Napier moved to separate from the province of Wellington which they did in 1858. The port and the rich agricultural lands of Hawkes Bay provided wealth to the city of Napier. The region was known as a major export port of NZ wool. More recently it has become known as the fruit bowl on NZ. It produces kiwi fruits, grapes (for wine), stone fruits etc. Timber is also exported from the port of Napier. Just a few kilometres away is the city of Hastings. Napier has around 62,000 inhabitants and Hastings 80,000. The district has 165,000 residents. The coastal flood plains are traversed by five rivers flowing down from the central tablelands and volcanic area. The major river is the Wairoa River. Hawkes Bay is a very seismically active region of NZ with over 50 damaging earthquakes recorded since 1800 but only 6 of these have occurred since 1934. The early 1930s was a dramatic period for Hawkes Bay. A major earthquake occurred on 3rd February 1931 followed by subsequent earthquakes over the next three years. The 7.8 scale earthquake of 1931 was centred 15 kilometres from Napier. It struck mid-morning and killed 256 people and injured thousands with over 400 hundred admitted to hospital. Hundreds of aftershocks resulted. It remains NZ worst earthquake eclipsing even the more recent Christchurch earthquakes for damage and death. Most of the buildings of the city centres of Napier and Hastings were destroyed. Hawkes Bay lies almost directly on the fault line caused by the abutting of the Australia and Pacific tectonic plates. A 4,000 acre lagoon was drained and today Hawkes Bay airport, industrial estates and new housing lies on this reclaimed land. The earthquake set off fires (and many buildings were made of wood) and the fires raged for several day destroying what was left of some buildings. Fires were controlled very quickly in Hastings. The two cities were quite quickly rebuilt with government support within two years at the height of the Depression. Building regulations were changed and well-known architects rebuilt the cities in Art Deco style influenced by the rise of California with its Aztec and Spanish influenced Art Deco architecture. Even today there are only four specially designed buildings taller than five storeys in Napier. On a more positive note Napier decided to prosper from the earthquake and its Art Deco heritage. The Art Deco Trust was formed in 1985 and still operates an internationally recognised Art Deco festival each year in February. With local government support the Art Deco Trust employs 10 people and uses the services of 120 volunteers. It attracts around 25,000 people to Napier each year. Citizens of Napier dress in 1930s style for the Festival, vintage cars from the era are part of the festival, a public great Gatsby arty is held in a city park, movie events, art shows, many jazz musical events, balls, dinners, parades, and an Art Deco spotter competition are all part of the festival. Among the 200 events is the Art Deco Dog Parade. Art Deco as a design and architectural style emerged at the Paris Exhibition of 1925. It became popular throughout the 1920s, 1930s and even into the 1940s. The style was applied to buildings, especially American skyscrapers, jewellery, china, lighting, furniture, etc. Unlike the Art Nouveau style which had emerged around 1900 with colours, curves and flowing detail the Art Deco style was rectangular, geometric and modern industrial techniques were used to achieve this style doing away with handicraft and hand worked items. Just think of the designs used in the Poirot detective TV series from Agatha Christie. The designers drew their inspirations from old European, Mayan, Aztec, and in the case of New Zealand, Maori design elements. The European influences led to the Spanish Mission style of architecture with simulated adobe brick, rounded terracotta window shades, roof tiles, roof parapets etc. The American influences developed Mayan and Aztec and sometimes North American Indian elements with zigzags, stepped patterns etc. One special feature of Art Deco buildings was the colourful and soft pastel shades of varying depths of colour used on the decorative features. Art Deco buildings can be found across the world with many in Adelaide but unlike Napier there is no concentration of buildings in any one area and they have not been maintained since the 1930s. Art Deco buildings in Adelaide no longer have some of the design elements as they have been removed with modernisation, the colour schemes have been painted out and often replaced with current gaudy or grey colour schemes designed to hide the Art Deco elements. Art Deco was popular for 1930s hotels in Adelaide and suburbs and Art Deco, especially the Spanish Mission style was popular for domestic housing in the 1930s. Napier, along with Miami in Florida and Santa Barbara in California have concentrations of Art Deco buildings, but Miami has especially grand multi storey buildings in the Art Deco style that you do not find in Napier. Napier Art Deco Trust applied for UNESCO World Heritage status for the city and its Art Deco heritage but this was rejected. Napier is special because of the earthquake behind the erection of the Art Deco buildings and the use of Maori motifs in some of its buildings. Within days of the earthquake the NZ government established a Rehabilitation Committee and all houses could have one chimney repaired free of charge before residents re-occupied their homes. The government loaned money to start the rebuilding of commercial premises (but not to banks or international companies) near Civic Square. Loans were granted interest free for up to three years for commercial businesses. Two government Commissioners were appointed to oversee works and loans. They immediately contacted some Napier architects. The architects sought out ideas from American architectural pattern books and photographs and the five leading architectural practices agreed to share their limited resources and to rebuild with the city with a sense of unity and common style. The leading architectural firms were Finch and Westerholm who specialised in Spanish Mission style; Louis Hay a local who was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright in America and his best building was the National Tobacco Company building; Natusch & Sons who specialised in houses and restrained Art Deco style; E A Williams who produced some quite flamboyant buildings; and J T Watson who became the Napier Borough Architect and is known for the Colonnade, Sunbay, Parker Fountain, esplanade Soundshell and the Egyptian inspired Municipal Theatre.

The quake, which killed two people and caused billions of dollars of damage, ruptured a complex set of geological faults near the surface. He and others described their findings last week in Denver, Colorado, at a meeting of the Seismological Society of America. The November Kaikoura tremor is a rare example of a large quake triggering widespread slow slip. A dangerous boundary A spate of large earthquakes has rattled New Zealand in the past decade, including one in 2011 that devastated the city of Christchurch. But the Kaikoura tremor stands out for its geological complexity. At least 21 separate faults broke along the way. Landslides buried roads and the shaking damaged buildings in the central business district of Wellington. The earthquake immediately triggered slow-slip movement in at least three separate areas, according to GNS Science. The regions stretched from off the east coast of the North Island to the northern part of the South Island. Most of the slow slip ceased within weeks, although a little of it continues. earthquake would have. The areas in motion surround a section that experiences no slow slip at all. This region, extending east of Wellington, may be locked and building up stress that could break in the next large quake. Seismologists have observed slow-slip movement in other subduction zones, in some cases coming before large tremors, including the devastating magnitude-9 Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. How the two phenomena relate to one another is not entirely clear. Peering into the future The revelations from New Zealand could alter future planning in quake-prone areas. Earthquake forecasts look at past seismic activity and calculate the probability of tremors of a certain magnitude within a certain time period. They typically do not include the effects of slow slip. That is a relatively low probability, but is still six times higher than it was before the quake. With the New Zealand government busy retrofitting buildings and roads in preparation for future quakes, researchers are working to quantify what they do and do not know. Researchers will gain greater insight into slow-slip movement late this year and next, when several project teams descend on the region. In November, the JOIDES Resolution ship will begin the first of two expeditions to drill into the slow-slip area off the New Zealand coast. A ship-borne seismic survey, to begin in early 2018, will provide a 3D look at where the slow slip is happening. And a bevy of new ocean-bottom seismometers will track the shaking as the plates continue to move. This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on April 24, 2017.
