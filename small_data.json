Unlike the General Election in November, where the winner represents their district in the Virginia General Assembly or U.S. Congress, the winner of Tuesday's primary election only becomes their party's representative in the upcoming general election. Before casting a ballot, Virginia voters in the primary election must declare whether they want a Republican or Democratic ballot.

Because no Democrats are contesting incumbents Rep. Donald McEachin (D - 4th District) and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D- Virginia), those candidates have already won their party's nominations. Therefore, no Democratic ballot available in the 4th Congressional District - which encompasses the City of Richmond, eastern Henrico County, and points to the south and east. Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Dan Ward are facing off in the 7th U.S. House District race. The winner will face incumbent Rep. Dave Brat (R - 7th District).

That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District.

All 140 seats of the Virginia General Assembly are up for election next month, but many voters won't have much of a choice at the ballot box on Election Day. Less than half of contests for state Legislature will have more than one candidate, and only a small percentage of contested races are expected to be close. For critics of the state's current electoral map, the lack of meaningful competition is largely a symptom of what they say are unfairly drawn maps designed to benefit incumbents. In the state Senate, 22 out of 40 races have more than one candidate, but only six are expected to be close. In the House, only 38 out of 100 have two or more candidates, with only a handful expected to be competitive. The chief architect of the 2011 Republican legislative redistricting plan testified in federal court earlier this year that raw political self-interest was at work when the maps were being drawn. Del. S. Chris Jones testified that he tried to accommodate requests from 75 to 80 delegates who sought to tweak lines, sometimes to draw out precincts where they had historically performed poorly or to draw out a potential primary challenger. But those requests were made by Republicans and Democrats alike, and GOP lawmakers dispute that the current map is squelching competition. Republican Del. Greg Habeeb, said there are many factors that explain the lack of competition, and a lack of effort by the Democratic Party to recruit candidates is one of them. He noted that Republicans currently control more than a dozen House districts that President Barack Obama won in 2012. Some of those seats aren't being contested this year by Democrats. This year's lack of competition isn't a new phenomenon nor is it unique to Virginia, said Ronald L. Heinemann, professor emeritus of History at Hampden-Sydney College and biographer of U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr., whose political machine controlled Virginia politics for more than 40 years. Under the Byrd machine, legislative lines were drawn to favor rural districts over urban areas and often had to be redrawn under court order, Heinemann said. That's an outcome Democrats and some advocates are hoping will happen again. A panel of federal judges has ruled 2 to 1 that Virginia's congressional maps should be redrawn after Democrats filed a lawsuit alleging that Republicans unconstitutionally crowded black voters into one particular congressional seat. Democrats were hoping for a similar outcome based on the same legal arguments involving the state House districts, but a different panel of federal judges ruled 2 to 1 on Thursday that the current state House districts were legal. The plaintiffs in the case have signaled they intend to appeal. A third redistricting lawsuit was filed in state court last month by a nonprofit group alleging that 11 House and Senate districts need be redrawn because they not compact, which state law requires. from loading.

Local elections boards met around the state Wednesday to count provisional ballots and conduct what is known as canvassing, which involves reviewing calculations, tapes from voting machines and other Election Day records to make sure no obvious errors occurred. That process is expected to be completed by Thursday. The results then will be forwarded to the Virginia State Board of Elections. The board will review the results and formally certify them on Nov. 28. Only at that point can a losing candidate petition the circuit court in his home county for a recount. The candidate would have 10 days from certification to do so. A Republican pick-up of two Senate seats would divide the 40-member chamber evenly between Republicans and Democrats. Any tie votes would be broken by Bolling, a Republican. The only other time the chamber split 20-20 Democrats and Republicans split power as part an agreement with both parties sharing control of committees. Saslaw said if Houck loses, then Norment will be able to decide whether Republicans take outright control or allow the two parties to share power. The two spoke Tuesday night. Three races were too close to call, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell said late Tuesday. They repeatedly compared Virginia Democrats to President Obama, featuring him in Republican TV ads, mailers and brochures. If the Democratic-led Senate was not able to stop Republican proposals, they said, the state would move too far to the right. Republicans had the edge in nearly every other way: They raised millions of additional dollars, recruited more candidates and benefited from an increasingly unpopular Democratic president and an increasingly popular Republican governor. Republican had another advantage: more candidates. The GOP had to persuade one delegate to give up his safe House seat and a senator to move and challenge an incumbent. Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple (D-Arlington), who serves as chairwoman of her caucus, said Democrats never seriously considered recruiting candidates for more than the 22 seats they already control and the pair of new Republican-leaning districts created in redistricting. He lost. Tom Mills, retired after 23 years of service in the Army, said his anger against Obama led him to vote for every Republican he could find on the ballot at Hayfield Elementary School in Fairfax County. But former governor Timothy M. Kaine, a former national party chairman who is running for U.S. Senate next year, said Republicans tried to cast the spotlight off their own ineffective policies. He and his wife voted for Sen. George Barker, hoping not only to keep him in office but also to thwart GOP hopes for a Senate takeover. National politics Republicans began plotting their takeover in 2009 after a Democrat narrowly won a special election for a Fairfax County senate seat left vacant when Ken Cuccinelli II (R) was elected attorney general. The loss of that seat served as a wake-up call. Senate leaders sought advice from House Republicans, a more conservative group with marked electoral success, but one they had sparred with for years. They told incumbent senators to mail constituents regularly and hold telephone town halls. They hired a fundraiser and a press secretary for the first time. Republicans also kept the successful infrastructure it had in place in 2009 and 2010, including 11 offices across the state, and picked up the tab for get-out-the-vote efforts and most campaign mailers. Democrats boasted of making more than 2 million calls and door knocks through the campaign, trying to contact each potential voters three times each. Democrats were outraised but insisted they had enough money to be competitive.

But hours later, the Democrat trailing in that race filed another lawsuit in federal court. The suit was just one front in the struggle for House control, which could turn on three exceedingly close elections. All three appear headed for state-funded recounts. In one of the three, 10 votes separate the candidates. Stafford County Circuit Court Judge Victoria Willis denied the legal defense fund's request for an injunction, which would have required local elections officials to wait a week before declaring a winner in the race. The judge ruled that the group lacked standing to bring the suit because it was not clear that the two voters named as plaintiffs had been harmed. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the legal defense fund, told the judge that she had been unable to confirm reports that one or both of the plaintiffs had attended an elections board meeting a day earlier to defend their votes. Ifill said she had not been able to reach either. Ifill indicated in court that the group would seek to file another lawsuit on behalf of other voters who cast provisional ballots. In the meantime, Willis's ruling cleared the way for the county electoral board to begin counting provisional ballots cast in the race to succeed retiring House speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). View Graphic Virginia general election guide On election night, Republican Robert Thomas led Democrat Joshua Cole by 86 votes, a margin later adjusted to 84 after a few errors were corrected. After tallying provisional ballots Tuesday, Cole picked up two votes, shaving Thomas's lead to 82. The board also voted against counting 55 absentee ballots that were in dispute. The Democratic Party of Virginia said on Veterans Day that those ballots, believed to be from active-duty military voters, were left in the registrar's mailbox on Election Day. But elections officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, said that was not the case. The ballots were run-of-the-mill absentee ballots and were not delivered until 10 a.m. Nov. 8, the morning after the election, they said. Electoral Board Chairman Doug Filler, whose daughter is Del. Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax), argued that the ballots should be counted, suggesting that the post office might have been responsible for their delayed arrival. By Tuesday night, the Virginia House Democratic Caucus announced it had filed a lawsuit on Cole's behalf in Federal Court in Alexandria, demanding that the 55 absentee ballots be counted. Before the election, Republicans enjoyed a 66-to-34 majority in Richmond's lower chamber. Now, Democrats are within striking distance of taking control. They need one more victory to force a power-sharing deal with Republicans and two more to take the reins of the chamber for the first time since 2000. Democrats have secured wins in 49 out of 100 seats, with Republicans holding narrow leads in the Thomas-Cole contest and two others. After elections officials examined provisional ballots cast in District 40 on Monday, Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) saw his 115-vote lead over Democrat Donte Tanner shrink to 106 votes. In District 94, Del. David E. Yancey (R-Newport News) had his 13-vote lead over Democrat Shelly Simonds dwindle to 10.

And Virginia was the state that voted closest to national percentages in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. The Kentucky result was particularly striking. Retiring Democratic governor Steve Beshear was a big booster of Obamacare and extended Medicaid to many low-income Kentuckians. The Democratic nominee, Attorney General Jack Conway, is an adept politico. Republican nominee Matt Bevin was distrusted by insiders for running in the primary against Senator Mitch McConnell in 2014, and he had a business record open to attack. The RealClearPolitics average of public polls showed Conway leading 44 to 41 percent. But Bevin won by 53 to 44 percent. But Bevin carried 106 of the 118 others. The Republican exceeded his. This would explain similar phenomena in the 2014 races in Kansas and Virginia. The results in Louisiana and Mississippi were similar. We have been told frequently that a surge of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Millennials into the electorate will move it inexorably toward Democrats. But the single prominent Democrat, John Bel Edwards, got 40 percent, and the winner among three prominent Republicans, Senator David Vitter, got only 23 percent. Vitter, like Bevin, has weaknesses as a candidate and could lose the November 16 runoff. But in Louisiana and Kentucky, Democrats got fewer votes than their counterparts have in elections (except for 1999, not seriously contested in either state) since 1972 and 1967, respectively. The last time a Mississippi Democratic governor candidate got fewer votes was in 1963. This happened even though Mississippi and Louisiana have higher percentages of blacks than any other state. Spontaneous heavy turnout by blacks made these states two of only five to give Barack Obama higher percentages in 2012 than 2008. Turnout, particularly Democratic turnout, declined from 2008 to 2012 presidentially and from 2010 to 2014 congressionally. Barack Obama got 3.5 million fewer votes in 2012 than in 2008.

But further down ballot, the usually sleepy state legislative contests are drawing an unusual surge of interest from Democrats across the country. President Trump's election sprouted a network of activists who want to flip seats blue. It served as a wake-up call for Democrats to pay attention to lower-profile state races as a way to chart a path back to power. For a new crop of Democratic groups, Virginia is the opening salvo and a testing ground ahead of what they hope is a wave election in 2018. It's also a purple state where Democrats have been winning statewide since 2009, but Republicans hold 66 of the 100 seats in the House of Delegates. An organization founded by wealthy Virginia donors and bankrolled by a Silicon Valley entrepreneur is beta-testing technology to help low-budget campaigns run more efficiently. Activists in solidly Democratic states are forming groups to help Virginia from afar, by fundraising and making phone calls. They benefit from a massive war chest accumulated after years of controlling the chamber, increased financial support from the long-standing Republican State Leadership Committee and the name recognition and legislative record that comes with incumbency. While Democrats this year have also looked for clues about 2018 in a handful of special elections to fill congressional vacancies around the country, Virginia's legislative races may be a better bellwether because the turnout will be similar to the midterms, said David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Many disagree about whether to pour resources into races perceived as winnable, such as those where the Republican incumbent is retiring or where Hillary Clinton prevailed last year or whether to try to expand the map to red-leaning rural and suburban districts. Not every lesson from Virginia will translate to other states. Lax finance campaign rules in the Old Dominion allow groups to pour in unlimited sums and directly coordinate with campaigns.

The Senate races will be crucial for the term-limited Mr. McAuliffe and his prospects for advancing his agenda, as Statehouse Republicans have largely thwarted his big-ticket plans since he took office in January 2014. Mr. McAuliffe said recently that electing Democrats to the state Senate will help him advance his agenda on items such as Medicaid expansion, gun control and education spending even with a Republican-controlled House. Two Senate races drawing much of the attention as pickup opportunities for both sides are the contests to replace retiring Sens. Charles J. Colgan, Manassas Democrat, and John C. Watkins, Powhatan Republican. Mr. McAuliffe has accused Mr. Parrish and other Republicans of lying about the issue.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Bill Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Both candidates emphasize kitchen-table issues such as economic development and education. But sharp ideological differences were on display last week as they appeared at a candidate forum. Sturtevant emphasized the need to reduce tax and regulatory burdens on businesses. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

Tim Kaine, D-Va., plays the harmonica as he joins the Cary Street Ramblers during a campaign kickoff rally in Richmond, Va., April 2. Kaine is running for a second term in the U.S. Senate, and Democrats are feeling pretty confident about his chances. This has the Democrats feeling optimistic for the federal midterm elections this year. Though the primaries are not until June 12, some patterns are already beginning to emerge. On the other side of the partisan divide, the major contenders for the Republican nomination for his seat are a very strange bunch indeed; all of them hail from the extremist right wing of the GOP. The biggest name, and the biggest mouth, belongs to Corey Stewart, the chair of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, in Northern Virginia. Stewart ran for governor in the Republican primary last year, but lost to GOP apparatchik Ed Gillespie. However, he got enough votes that he appears to have moved Gillespie to the right on some issues, especially immigration. He is also an opponent of the demand for more control of access to firearms. Stewart is up for re-election to his county position next year, so not only is it unlikely he can defeat Kaine, but he may be relegated to the electoral wilderness entirely. The other GOP candidates are strange birds also. Nick Freitas is a one-term member of the Virginia House of Delegates. He too makes no concessions to the moderate center. And, of course, Freitas is a Second Amendment extremist. One such bill did make it through the legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Northam. The third Republican candidate for Senate is E.W. Jackson, an African-American lawyer and a minister at Exodus Faith Ministries. Jackson ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012, but was beaten by a wide margin by George Allen. The following year, he ran for lieutenant governor against Democrat Ralph Northam, but lost by a moderate margin. Northam was elected governor last year. He has said similar things about LGBTQ people. Now a candidate for public office, Jackson has tried to distance himself from such comments by claiming that his statements should only be seen in the context of his pastoral work and do not represent how he would handle his responsibilities as a senator. Jackson has been equally fierce in denouncing undocumented immigrants and those who would protect them. House races: Where the action is The most interesting action, though, is currently in the House elections. Until recently, the only federal House electoral district seen at play was the 10th, in Northern Virginia. Although Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock was re-elected in 2016, Hillary Clinton carried the district over Donald Trump by a margin of 52.2 to 42.2 percent that year, and Northam won handily there last year. The district is one of the wealthiest in the country, but also has a large number of inhabitants, and voters, who are not from the old South, with its toxic Confederate memories. The weaker candidates have been gradually withdrawing, and it is expected that the number who actually will be in contention will be much smaller. But still, it is going to be a contested Democratic primary. Though Hill is seen as a fringe candidate, it is suspected by some that the purpose of his candidacy is to pull Comstock further to the right. On some issues, she has aligned with Trump and his allies in recent votes in the House. She also voted for HR 806, which weakens EPA standards for ozone. The gun control issue may be particularly difficult for Comstock to navigate. Though the hard core Republican base is fanatically opposed to gun control, recent shootings like the one in Parkland, Florida and the huge youth-led demonstrations that have followed have energized people on the other side of the issue. Comstock has been sharply criticized for her acceptance of National Rifle Association money. These and others will be the issues that her Democratic adversary will bring up in the general election. Currently, however, more attention is being paid to the Democratic primary. Candidate Dan Helmer criticized another candidate, State Sen. Jennifer Wexton, for having supported a compromise deal on concealed carry legislation, which had been brokered by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, in 2016. Wexton defended herself, saying that at the time the deal was the best solution that could be achieved. Some consider Wexton a favorite in the election because of the list of endorsements by public officials that she has racked up. But a lot can happen between now and June 12.

But when a reporter asked what message his victory sends to the president, the governor-elect described it as a rejection of divisive Trump-era politics. The Democratic ticket appealed to voters because it focused on the economy, education and health care, Northam said. Democrats also made unexpectedly large gains in the House of Delegates. Northam thanked his ticketmates, who were not present. Northam spoke in a Capitol Square office building, cheered by members of outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe's Cabinet and staffers. Afterward, Northam and his wife, Pam, walked next door to the Executive Mansion for lunch with McAuliffe (D) and first lady Dorothy McAuliffe. The governor struck a more partisan note afterward, when asked if the win would put the Democratic Party back on track nationally after finger-pointing over the 2016 presidential election erupted last week between former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile and Hillary Clinton allies. McAuliffe also was more blunt than Northam about Democratic wins in the House of Delegates, which under GOP domination successfully thwarted McAuliffe's marquee campaign promise: expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. After Tuesday's gains, Democrats could share power with Republicans or perhaps take control of the chamber, pending the outcome of some races that have yet to be decided. Northam made reference to the House gains as well, but in manner so playfully understated that it drew laughs. McAuliffe also said the election was a validation of his administration's work to bolster economic development and to thwart socially conservative legislation by issuing a record number of vetoes. With the McAuliffes and Northams huddled in the foyer, and massive bleachers already under construction outside the Capitol, the gathering had the feel of Inauguration Day, although the keys to the mansion won't change hands until Jan. 13. He has no plans to fade from public life, although he declined, as usual, to comment on a potential run for president in 2020. After leaving office, McAuliffe said he would devote himself to charitable work and to Democratic causes: redistricting and gubernatorial races. Both will require travel around the country that would be helpful for a potential presidential candidate. It was a nod to struggling areas that have gone heavily red in recent elections, including Tuesday's. He noted his plans for ensuring every corner of the state has broadband and cellphone coverage and expanding the University of Virginia's campus in Wise County. Northam renewed his pledge to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, an initiative that probably would have been a non-starter had the House of Delegates retained its 66-to-34 Republican majority. Republicans have a 21-to-19 edge in the state Senate, whose members were not on the ballot this year. Northam also said he hoped he could usher in new gun-control measures, something else the GOP-dominated House has long thwarted. Northam also said he would fight the opioid epidemic and discrimination, promote government efficiency and renewable energy, and ensure that all students have access to quality education. He purchased the kegerator himself to seal a deal with one of the many craft breweries he has lured to the state. Read more: Her opponent used male pronouns to describe her.

If the House of Delegates ends up in a 50-50 split, Democrats and Republicans will have to negotiate a power-sharing agreement. Quentin Kidd, a political scientist at Christopher Newport University, said that even slim Republican majorities present major hurdles for Democrats. For example, a Republican speaker can assign lawmakers to committees in a way to keep legislation from reaching the full floor for debate. Some moderate House Republicans who may have crossed party lines lost their seats on Nov. 7. And Democrats may not be united on contentious issues with tough reelection battles just two years away. The battle for the majority continues outside the election cycle. Northam can offer incumbent GOP lawmakers jobs in his administration, creating pickup opportunities for Democrats. Then-Gov. Jim Gilmore (R) used that tactic in 1998 to erode Democratic majorities in the legislature. Even if politicking and parliamentary maneuvering puts Democrats over the top, some of the more liberal members of the General Assembly say they are realistic about the prospects of far-left legislation. Kim Propeack, a leader of the pro-immigrant group CASA in Action, said Virginia Democrats should resist the urge to be overly cautious. Comments The story must be told.

The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda. All 140 seats in the General Assembly were on the ballot. Democrats could have taken control by picking up just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). But Republicans held all of their seats. View Graphic See the full results for statewide and local races. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), meanwhile, held out hope that the results could change. He said he suspected irregularities in a Richmond-area race won by the GOP because Republican turnout was so heavy. As of late Tuesday night, Democrat Dan Gecker had not conceded to his opponent, Glen Sturtevant. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a record tax hike in 2004. But Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. McAuliffe faces a more conservative Senate Republican caucus and a House with a wide GOP majority. McAuliffe, once a record-smashing fundraiser for his close friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, had hoped a win would help sway purple Virginia in 2016. National donors and outside groups on the left and right seized on the state Senate races. Republicans and Democrats alike went into Tuesday predicting success. The party sent out a two-page memo to reporters laying out reasons why this might not be its year. It noted that Republicans tend to vote in off-year elections such as this one, that Democrats are playing in traditionally Republican districts and that money has flowed in from outside groups. Fatigue from a seventh year of the Obama White House hurts even more, Democrats said. McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, favors Medicaid expansion, gun control and abortion rights. Democrats conceded that unseating Black would be as difficult as their quest to oust incumbent Republican Frank W. Wagner in Virginia Beach. Wagner withstood a challenge from Democrat Gary McCollum. Wagner, the former owner of a ship repair company, seemed vulnerable after reports that he took gifts from special interests and sponsored legislation friendly to Dominion Virginia Power. But McCollum was stung by revelations that he misrepresented his military record. Nearby, Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack) successfully defended a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger was Republican Richard H. Ottinger. In southwest Virginia, Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) prevailed in a three-way race against Republican Nancy Dye and Democrat-turned-independent Don Caldwell. Along with gun control, highway tolls came to dominate races in Northern Virginia late in the campaign. Democratic candidates said they opposed it as well, but the GOP contended that they could not be trusted to buck a governor of their own party once in office. They used the attacks against Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) and Democratic state delegate candidates John Bell and Jennifer Boysko. Meanwhile in the House of Delegates, in preliminary returns, Republicans appeared to narrowly lose their veto-proof majority, but they still maintained a huge advantage over Democrats in the polarized chamber. House Democrats picked up two seats in districts formerly held by Republicans who did not seek reelection. Boysko defeated businessman Danny Vargas (R) for Del. Bell defeated Republican Chuong Nguyen for the seat held by David I. Ramadan (R-Loudoun). Late Tuesday, Murphy was embroiled in a tight race with Craig Parisot, the Republican she narrowly defeated in a special election last year. This time around, less than 200 votes separated the candidates, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Fairfax County officials said that they will recheck the totals for Murphy and Parisot on Wednesday to see whether a recount is warranted.

Using the prospect of a deadlocked Senate as leverage, Democrats are trying to beef up their influence on crucial committees, where the fate of legislation is largely decided. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) and Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) laid out their demands in a letter they had hand-delivered Friday to Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City). But Saslaw said the effort was akin to the ordinary horse-trading that goes on during any General Assembly session. As Senate Democrats attempt to leverage their newfound muscle for more committee power, their counterparts in the House of Delegates hope only to amend the budget approved Sunday by the House Appropriations Committee. The committee had added millions of dollars for schools, local governments and health care, but that still fell far short of what Democrats desired. The funds are usually provided to Northern Virginia school districts to woo employees in the expensive job market. At a meeting of the Northern Virginia legislators Monday, House Democrats vowed to try to round up the votes needed to add cost-of-competing funds to the budget. But they acknowledged it would be a nearly impossible task; Republicans outnumber Democrats 67-32, with one independent who caucuses with Republicans. But funding still falls short of what some Senate Democrats would have liked. On the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, Sen. Ryan T. McDougle (R-Hanover) ticked off many of the programs Republicans had agreed to better fund at the request of Democrats. Saslaw and McEachin have asked that more Democrats get appointed to certain committees, that some Republicans get removed, and that leadership of the powerful Senate Finance Committee be split between Republican and Democratic co-chairs. Their proposal would affect six of the 11 Senate committees, which Democrats had controlled for four years.

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. After Mark Warner's nail-biting reelection night, I tore apart the Warner campaign's claim that they ran significantly ahead of other Democrats in Virginia's rural areas, with a follow-up diary comparing Mark Warner to Tom Perriello. Today, I want to take the time to follow up on some of the areas I picked as canaries in the coal mine of Virginia politics. While dissecting Election 2014 by House of Delegates and State Senate district is still being finalized by the good people at VPAP, here are some preliminary findings. 9th House of Delegates District (Franklin, Henry, Patrick Counties): The 9th had been at the center of Warner's crossover support in 2008, and featured a lively fight by Ward Armstrong after Republicans targeted him in their gerrymandering. This is a unique district, the influence of Virginia Tech makes it very different than other Southwest districts. It also remained one of the best districts for Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis. Virginia Politics Mike Hamlar, 19th District State Senate Candidate Dan Sullivan - August 7, 2014 5 There is a refreshing candidate in Southwest Virginia ready to take on Ralph Smith for the 19th District state Senate seat. Mike Hamlar is a Roanoke native who excelled at athletics in high school, earning a football scholarship to Wake Forest. Returning home he's become an established high energy local entrepreneur. Mike has three businesses. He is a third generation co-owner of Hamlar-Curtis Funeral Home which has been serving the community for 62 years. In 2009, Michael started Hamlar Enterprises, which is a business brokerage firm. The firm has engaged in multi-million dollar deals across the region, handling mergers, business acquisitions, business evaluations etc. In 2012, Michael and his wife, Katina, established Hamlar Properties, which is a property real estate firm that manages and oversees real estate transactions. Mike is also an adjunct professor at American National University in Salem, VA. At Wake Forest University Mike played football under Jim Caldwell and was on the Seattle Bowl championship team that defeated the University of Oregon. He is accustomed to winning and wants to take this race to the Republican incumbent, Ralph Smith. A family man with three young children, Mike is faith-driven and confident that he can win this race. That will be a task. Mike likes to say that if you look at the 19th district, it is as though his one-year-old drew it. It encompasses part of Roanoke County, all of Floyd County, all of Salem, part of Montgomery County, all of Wythe and Carroll Counties, and part of Bedford. From end to end it stretches about 120 miles from end to end, not the way the crow flies, but the way the SUV drives, and it takes at least three sweeps to hit every location in it. That is why he has started early. He plans kickoffs in every locality. Recently appointed by Governor McAuliffe to the Secure Commonwealth Panel, Mike is involved in the community both in business and local civic organizations like the Kiwanis Club, so he is hardly starting from a standstill or without connections. And quite frankly it seems he is always in motion, with clear aims. Right now his goal is to become as well known throughout the district as he is in Roanoke. He is certainly well liked among local Democrats. His priorities are education, Medicaid expansion (which he hopes is accomplished before he makes it to the Senate), and economic development. He points out that a program like Marketplace Virginia would create 30,000 jobs while providing necessary preventive healthcare. Not yet the official Democratic nominee, he is eager to gain that distinction so that he can focus solely on Republican Smith. This further solidifies the argument that Jones is no more than a strawman for whomever feeds his self-perceived competence. While this certainly will save the Central Committee substantial time and effort at the meeting on March 15, if true, the announcement will come as a pre-emptive strike that is not so surprising, yet will serve to allay any illusion that the DPVA functions for the benefit of its members. And it will be good news for the Republican Party of Virginia, despite themselves, because it would guarantee that the DPVA will lack the focus required to maintain control of the State Senate beyond 2015. The best part of this ham-handed move is that it alienates the party members who reside in districts that are currently held by Republicans; as in the grassroots members who the DPVA needs the most to accomplish any gains anywhere. While a competent, experienced, incumbent Executive Director would be able to manipulate a marionette Chair with one hand, it will probably require both hands just to keep the ship steady in the heavy rolls that can be anticipated with the staff changes that have already taken place. Advice to the powers that be: don't ask for unanimous consent or acclamation at the Central Committee. It doesn't exist. Update: The revised version from the RTD.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

The Democratic Party in Virginia failed to pick up even one state Senate seat in their elections. Social conservatives defeated an LGBT equality measure in Houston. Ohio's controversial proposal to legalize marijuana didn't stand a chance. Put simply: conservatives and their causes had a great election night 2015. But, defeated Democrats can still lay claim to some historic victories Tuesday. Here are five: 1. Kentucky Democrats hang on to two statewide seats Kentucky Secretary of State-elect Alison Lundergan Grimes speaks to her supporters at the Kentucky Democratic Party election night watch party at the Frankfort Convention Center in Frankfort, Ky., Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015. And yes, Kentucky's entire balance of power shifted Tuesday. Kentucky Democrats, who used to control five statewide offices, now hold just two. But those two victories were hard-fought and significant wins for Democrats. Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes narrowly hung onto her seat, besting a political newcomer with 51.2 percent of the vote. And, Andy Beshear, son of popular outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear (D), beat a rising Republican star (and millions in outside money from the Republican Attorneys General Association) to take the attorney general seat with just 50.1 percent of the vote. 2. Indianapolis's Democratic sweep Joe Hogsett speaks to his supporters as he announces his candidacy for mayor of Indianapolis at the Landmark for Peace Memorial at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Park, in Indianapolis. The outgoing Republican mayor of Indianapolis will hand the keys to Democrat Joe Hogsett, who crushed his Republican opponent, 63 percent to 37 percent. Democrats now control all major citywide and countywide elected offices in the city. They also have a majority (even if it's just one seat) on the City-County Council for just the third time since 1969. Another first: This was the first election since the city council districts were redrawn after the 2010 census. 3. Democrats continue their dominance in Charlotte Charlotte mayoral candidate Jennifer Roberts speaks to supporters with husband Manley Roberts at Jackelope Jacks on Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015, in Charlotte, N.C. But she wasn't the only victory her party celebrated Tuesday. Democrats also won all four at-large city council seats. The party is getting used to winning Charlotte. Even though Democrats make up just about half of the city's voters, The Charlotte Observer's Steve Harrison points out that Republicans haven't won a mayoral or at-large race in the past three elections. The city's last Republican mayor held office in 2009, and with each passing year, Republicans have struggled to find competitive candidates to put up for at-large council spots. 4. Democrats take over Pennsylvania's Supreme Court Philadelphia Judge Kevin Dougherty, a Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania Supreme Court poses for a selfie with a supporter on election day, Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015, in Philadelphia. That means they have a 5-2 majority on a previously Republican-dominated court, which is recovering from scandals (justices from both sides of the aisle have recently resigned in e-mail porn scandals and amid corruption charges). And with potentially good reason. The court could get to decide a number of important cases including on voter ID, education funding and abortion initiatives. 5. A lonely Deep South Democrat remains standing Attorney General Jim Hood, center, greets supporters at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Jackson, Miss., after winning re-election on Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015. Hood won a fourth term and remains the only Democrat elected to statewide office in Mississippi. Hood beat his Republican opponent 56 percent to 44 percent. He remains the only Democratic statewide elected official in the Deep South. Hood has gained national recognition for his efforts to fight cybercrime, including sexual predators and online drug sales, and has cracked down on domestic violence and elderly abuse.

Yancey had emerged from Election Day with a 10-vote lead in the 94th District, but the recount uncovered enough additional ballots for Simonds to give her a one-vote victory. That seemed to set up the House for a rare 50-50 split between Republicans and Democrats, ending 17 years of GOP dominance and making headlines nationwide. But Republicans challenged that decision in court Wednesday, saying the voter had selected every other Republican on the ballot and intended to vote for Yancey.

James Alcorn, chairman of the State Board of Elections, said the winner will be chosen by placing names on slips of paper into two film canisters and then drawing the canisters from a glass bowl (or his bowler hat). The drawing has been scheduled for Dec. 27 11 a.m. at the elections board in Richmond. Complicating the tiebreaking vote is the need to ensure that both a Democratic and Republican representative of the three-member elections board will be available during the holidays. But it doesn't end there. If the loser of the coin toss is unhappy with that result, he or she can seek a second recount. The turnaround shocked Democrats, who on social media were still celebrating their unlikely rise to power in the House of Delegates. Before the Nov. 7 elections, Republicans outnumbered Democrats in that chamber by 66 to 34. The GOP has a smaller, 21-to-19 edge in the state Senate, where ties votes can be broken by a Democratic lieutenant governor. With Democrat Ralph Northam set to take over as governor on Jan. 13, the party is primed to flex its newfound muscle. But the Newport News outcome now leaves things unclear. Kenneth Mallory, a paid election official chosen by the Yancey team, had spotted the ballot about halfway through the Tuesday recount. The ballot was tossed aside as invalid, the precinct was wrapped up and the recount moved on. At the end of the day, Republican and Democratic officials alike stated that they were satisfied with the process and outcome. State law limits the ability of observers to communicate with election officials during the recount, but afterward, Alvarado sounded the alarm with Yancey's legal team, according to Republican lawyer Trevor Stanley. Stanley reached out to Mallory Tuesday evening, but Mallory declined to talk until he got assurances from the city's Electoral Board that he was allowed to do so, the lawyer said. Mallory, meanwhile, said he had been agonizing about his failure to act during the recount. A middle school civics teacher, Mallory, 33, said in an interview that he had wanted to take part in the recount so he could talk about it with his students. Finally, about 10 p.m. Tuesday, Yancey's team talked with Mallory and heard his concerns. They urged him to write out his thoughts and sign them so they could take them to court in the morning, when the judges would convene to certify the results. Once the judges read the letter and heard arguments from the lawyers, they spent two hours studying the ballot in question before ruling. GOP leaders in the House of Delegates, who on Tuesday had conceded the recount and pledged to share power with Democrats in what they believed would be a chamber split 50 to 50, issued a new statement after Wednesday's turn of events. It is not clear whether a final decision in the Simonds-Yancey matchup will settle control of the House of Delegates. Election officials on Wednesday evening were finishing a recount in the 68th House District in Richmond, where Republican Del. G. Manoli Loupassi trailed Democratic challenger Dawn Adams by 336 votes, but the outcome appeared unlikely to change. And a recount is set for Thursday in Fredericksburg's District 28, where the Republican leads by 82 votes. Democrats have also challenged that race in federal court, where they are seeking a new election because more than 100 voters were mistakenly given ballots for the wrong legislative district. House Democrats were meeting in Richmond on Wednesday night to elect their own leadership for the coming General Assembly session, which starts Jan. 10. They were set to vote on their designee for speaker but held off in light of the uncertainty in the Simonds-Yancey race and in District 28. Otherwise they reelected their current caucus leadership. House Minority Leader David J. Toscano (Charlottesville) is vying with his party's longest-serving member, Del. Kenneth R. Plum (Fairfax), for the speaker position. After the court's ruling threw the balance of power back toward Republicans, Plum said he thinks Democrats need to be realistic about what's ahead. Comments The story must be told.

On the Democratic side, meanwhile, two Asian American Democrats ran and fell short in the primaries, as did several women and African American candidates. The Democratic candidates nominated in competitive races Tuesday were entirely white and male. And if they figure out how to do it, the Virginia GOP could become a model for other crucial swing states where minority voters can make or break the outcome of elections. Both the Hispanic and Asian populations in the state are growing, especially in Northern Virginia. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), for instance, won his election in 2013 by a margin of just 54,000 votes. Not only do Republicans want to capture at least some sliver of this population, but they also want to signal to younger white voters that the party is inclusive. Two Republican women were nominated in Senate contests Tuesday and are expected to win in November. A third is challenging state Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke), who is vulnerable in a three-way race that includes an independent who could steal Democratic votes. In Loudoun County, Vietnamese immigrant Chuong Nguyen is running for the seat being vacated by Del. David I. Ramadan (R). Korean American Sang Yi is challenging Del. David L. Bulova (D) in Fairfax. All three districts have significant Asian and Hispanic populations. And in all these cases, along with a supervisor race in Fairfax, Republicans quickly rallied around their minority candidates, rather than throwing them into tough primaries. There is no stronger sign of the importance of minority voters to politicians than the growing number of community events and ethnic festivals appearing on the schedules of both Republicans and Democrats. Last year while on the congressional campaign trail in Northern Virginia, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) hopped from Latino-heavy Manassas to Indian and Pakistani festivals to the Vietnamese-dominated Eden Center shopping mall in Falls Church. A handful of officeholders also attended, including Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D), state Sen David W. Marsden (D-Fairfax) and Fairfax Board Chair Sharon Bulova (D). One wore a straw hat; another carried a handheld fan. They greeted constituents and visited food booths, sampling spring rolls and talking to the crowd. On stage, several of them attempted broken phrases of Korean and Spanish. Several Democrats were particularly bothered that the establishment rallied around Jeremy McPike for an open Senate seat in Prince William County over Atif Qarni, a math teacher and former Marine who entered the race first and with stronger fundraising. Minority communities have long felt taken for granted by a party that overwhelmingly wins the support of blacks, Latinos and Asians year after year. The open seat in Prince William, being vacated by Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D), is a rare swing seat on the edge of the D.C. region. Qarni said he thinks that some local party leaders were concerned that his Muslim religion would hamper his bid. In a 2011 Senate race, party leaders favored Arlington County Board member Barbara A. Favola (D) over lawyer Jaime Areizaga-Soto. According to a local blogger, she noted in a phone conversation that there are few Latinos in the district. Del. Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William), who is African American, got little support before his surprise victory in a 2013 House of Delegates race. In the D.C. suburbs, so many offices are held by Democrats that turnover is rare and open seats attract multiple strong candidates. Lacking the internal ideological divisions that have bedeviled Republicans in the state, Democrats rarely challenge incumbents. She noted that the county party has two Hispanic candidates and one African American competing this fall: two for school board and one challenging Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax). In local races across Northern Virginia, four women and two African Americans were elected. Democrats remain the far more diverse party. Twenty of the 23 nonwhite state lawmakers in office are Democrats. Democratic districts, too, tend to be less white. The party is fielding a female challenger against Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun) and an African American man to take on Sen. Frank W. Wagner (R-Virginia Beach). In the Richmond area, two African American candidates were nominated for open House seats. Democrats are also rallying nonwhite voters via the legal system. Elizabeth Koh contributed to this report. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

Change has been coming to the increasingly diverse state for years, but the evolution was turbocharged by the provocative influence of Donald Trump. Democrat Ralph Northam won the governor's race over Republican Ed Gillespie by a comfortable nine-point margin, but Farnsworth said the outcome could have been much tighter if not for highly motivated anti-Trump voters. That was particularly evident in the state's suburban regions, where Northam racked up wide margins and Democratic challengers unseated Republican incumbents in the House of Delegates. The sentiment turned up in voices across the state. It was in eastern Henrico County outside Richmond, where a few days before the election Nick Hall was all set to vote for the Democrat for governor even though he wasn't sure of his name. Hall just wanted to strike back at the party of Trump. In exit polling, more than a third of voters said they came out to the polls to express opposition to Trump. Half that many said they voted to support Trump. View Graphic Virginia general election guide An especially striking aspect of that anti-Trump fervor was that most of those new candidates he inspired were women. Of the 15 Democrats who were on track to flip Republican seats in the House of Delegates, 11 were women. All of the delegates they will replace are men. There were only 17 women among the 100 members of the House of Delegates in its most recent session. The election stunned both sides. Northam drew ire from fellow Democrats just a few weeks ago, when he told Cox during a moment of bonhomie that he looked forward to working with him as speaker. That role is in question now as Democrats appear headed for at least a 50-50 split in the House, pending the resolution of a handful of close races. The president whipped Democrats into a frenzy, Albo said. He said it's not accurate to call Virginia more Democratic in the wake of the election. But rural red areas went for Gillespie in great numbers, sometimes even more than for Trump last year. And the Democratic Party itself, for all its huge gains, is going to have serious issues to resolve. What's more, it was Stanfield's group that came up with the anti-Dominion pledge signed by so many of the new candidates. Other Democrats, including Northam, have taken large contributions from Dominion, the state's largest corporate political donor, and favor the controversial natural gas pipeline it is building in rural parts of the state. The new Democratic wave could lead to chaos. It was an anachronistic reference at a time when the state seems to have put on a fresh face. But there's something else that might still limit the pace of change. Rachel Chason, Jenna Portnoy and Scott Clement contributed to this report. Comments The story must be told.

Currently Republicans hold 51 seats while Democrats hold 49, but several of those races were squeakers. In preliminary hearings this week, judges set dates for three of the four races heading to recount, according to spokesmen for both House Republicans and House Democrats. The first recount will be Dec. 13 and 14 in Fairfax and Prince William counties for the 40th District, where incumbent Del. Tim Hugo (R) narrowly won reelection by a 106-vote margin over Democrat Donte Tanner. The closest race heading to recount is the 94th District in Newport News, where Del. David E. Yancey (R) beat Shelly Simonds by 10 votes. That recount will be held Dec. 19. G. Manoli Loupassi (R-Richmond), who lost to Democrat Dawn Adams by 336 votes. A preliminary hearing that would determine the date for a recount in the 28th District has not yet been held. In that race, Republican Bob Thomas leads Democrat Joshua Cole by 82 votes in the contest to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). More than 100 voters in the 28th District and neighboring 88th District were given the wrong ballots, state elections officials say. In the 88th District, Del. No one is questioning the outcome of that race, even with the misassigned ballots, because the margin was so wide. Democrats and Republicans both say they expect the recount for the 28th District will be held Dec. 21. On Nov. 7, Virginians voted with paper ballots scanned by electronic machines. Recounts consider ballots that were deemed illegible, but where the voter intent may be clear, even if they did not follow the proper instructions for marking their choice. The state pays for recounts in races where the candidates are separated by less than half of a percentage point. The Loupassi-Adams race did not fall within that margin, and Loupassi must bear the costs. If Adams prevails in a recount and Democrats flip two of the other Republican-held seats after a recount, Democrats will take control of the chamber for the first time since 2000. If Adams prevails and Democrats pick up one seat, the chamber will be split 50-50 with no tiebreaking mechanism and the parties must negotiate a power-sharing agreement. Gov-elect.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

The Parrish family has held elected office in Manassas and Prince William County for decades. The seat had previously been held by 89-year-old Democrat Charles Colgan, the longest serving state senator in Virginia history, who opted not to run for re-election. The district profile tilts strongly toward Democrats, and McPike ran a campaign centered on education and transportation issues. The returns show that write-in ballots, likely to be overwhelmingly cast for Euille, have received 35 percent of the vote. Silberberg won a three-way Democratic primary over Euille and former Mayor Kerry Donley. He won re-election three times. In the House, the GOP maintained a clear advantage. With Republicans maintaining control of the General Assembly, McAuliffe lost a chance to gain leverage when negotiating with GOP lawmakers on matters like the state budget during the last two years of his term. 9:10 p.m. Republican Richard Black has won re-election to the Virginia state Senate, fighting off an aggressive challenge from Democrat Jill McCabe. With 80 percent of precincts reporting, Black had 53 percent of the vote, compared to 47 percent for McCabe. The district stretches through the conservative outer suburbs of Loudoun and Prince William counties. The letter prompted criticism from both human rights activists and Islamic State militants who are fighting Assad there. 8:20 p.m. Republican state Sen. Frank Wagner has defeated Democrat Gary McCollum in state Senate contest that Republicans needed to help keep control of the upper chamber. Wagner was ahead of McCollum 55 percent to 45 percent with 82 percent of the vote counted. The race was one of a handful of closely watched contested contests by leaders in both major political parties, which are fighting for control of the state Senate. 7 p.m. Polls have closed in Virginia, capping a hard-fought and expensive election season that will determine which party controls the state Senate. Virginians headed to the polls Tuesday to decide whether Republicans will keep their narrow majority in the upper chamber. The GOP is expected to maintain a clear advantage in the state House, limiting any advantage McAuliffe may get with a victory Tuesday. 5:30 p.m. The marquee race is the state Senate race to replace retiring Democrat Charles Colgan. Democrats are hoping that Jeremy McPike can fend off Republican Hal Parrish as Democrats seek to wrest control of the Senate from the GOP. Woodbridge resident Edwin Williams-Greer and his husband, Mark Williams-Greer, voted for McPike. Mark Williams Greer said he and his husband are two black, married men and what they heard from the Republican side was not good at all. His husband said gun control was an issue for him. Woodbridge resident Frances Sarno voted for Parrish. She said she came out primarily to vote for Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart, but was also persuaded to vote for Parrish. She said it could have been the ads that persuaded her. The contest featured heavy spending on both sides. 1:30 p.m. Republican Glen Sturtevant is doing some last-minute campaigning in a heavily Democratic area of the state Senate district he hopes to represent. Sturtevant was shaking hands with a steady stream of voters outside a polling place in the Museum District on Tuesday. Brendan Workman, a mortgage consultant, said Sturtevant seems more genuine than his opponent, Democrat Dan Gecker. Gun control has become a key issue in the race, with both the NRA and a gun-control group backed by Michael Bloomberg spending heavily on advertisements. 12:40 p.m. The Democratic Party of Virginia released a memo to the news media Tuesday morning that appears aimed at tempering expectations about Election Day results. 12:30 p.m. Voters in Chesterfield County cast ballots Tuesday in a heated state Senate race that could decide partisan control of the upper chamber. Ron Davis, a retiree, cast his ballot at Clover Hill Elementary School for Democrat Dan Gecker. Shearer, also a retiree, said no candidate should be so heavily financed by out-of-state interests. Republicans control the House of Delegates by an overwhelming majority. 10:30 a.m. A steady stream of voters filed into Janke Road Baptist Church in Richmond on Tuesday morning to vote in one of the key state Senate races.

His unsuccessful push to flip the Senate reduces his already slim chances of passing legacy-defining legislation during his tenure, said Bob Holsworth, a consultant and retired Virginia Commonwealth University political analyst. Holsworth noted that the chances of McAuliffe passing some of his top legislative priorities, like Medicaid expansion, with the House in firm GOP control were already slim. And McAuliffe, nearly halfway through his term-limited four year stint, has made clear that he is less interested than some of his predecessors in the legislative process and prefers to spend his time trying to lure businesses to build and expand in Virginia. With little hope for major Democratic-leaning legislative successes, McAuliffe will be free to focus even more on economic development efforts.

{"URL_s":"http://wapo.st/2A7a2Hb","Timestamp_s":"20180819002746","Sentences_t":"Caption Voters in Virginia elected Democrat Ralph Northam over Republican Ed Gillespie as the next governor. Astrid Riecken Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Gregory S. Schneider , Reporter Laura Vozzella , Reporter Fenit Nirappil , Reporter November 8, 2017 Democrat Ralph Shearer Northam won a hard-fought race to become Virginia's 73rd governor, beating Republican Ed Gillespie in an election watched around the nation as a judgment on President Trump and the politics of polarization. Voters chose Northam, the lieutenant governor, 54 percent to 45 percent over Gillespie as part of a stunning Democratic sweep of statewide offices, including lieutenant governor and attorney general. There also were widespread Democratic victories in the House of Delegates. The vote had national resonance as well. Gillespie, in turn, had dipped into Trump's playbook with strong law-and-order messages, but tried to keep his distance from the president in a state that now leans blue. Social media reaction Wednesday framed the Virginia governor's contest as a bellwether of the sentiments across the country, as some people predicted it was also a sign that the GOP faces big trouble ahead. Many voters said they were simply relieved that the election and its ads were over. Democrats at the Northam campaign party in Fairfax City broke into tears as results came in Tuesday evening, the outcome beyond what most had dared hope. For all the fury unleashed on the Virginia races by Trump and his followers, who lit up social media and tried to define the contests in terms of Confederate statues and Hispanic street gangs, Northam had seemed an unlikely standard-bearer to fight back. Even some fellow Democrats had criticized Northam for his low-key campaign style. But in the end, he won more votes than any previous Virginia governor, and it was a historic night for the party across many fronts. Voters energized by last fall's demoralizing loss by Hillary Clinton came out in large numbers to elect Democrat Justin Fairfax as lieutenant governor over Republican state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Fauquier), making Fairfax the first African American elected to a statewide office in Virginia since L. Douglas Wilder won as governor in 1989. Democratic Attorney General Mark R. Herring was reelected over Republican challenger John Adams. And Democrats were poised to pick up at least 14 seats in the House of Delegates after fielding a historic number of challengers, many of them women. Among them is Danica Roem, who defeated longtime Republican incumbent Robert G. Marshall in Prince William County to become the first openly transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature. Six more House seats were in play as of late Tuesday, with four of those headed for recounts. The Democrats needed to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the House of Delegates. That would be a stunning turnaround in a body where Republicans had a seemingly insurmountable 66-to-34 advantage. All 100 seats were up for election. Whether you voted for me or not, we are all Virginians. As he has traveled the country, McAuliffe said, the pressure from other Democrats to perform in this election has been enormous. The victors basked in the idea that they had just shown something to the nation. Gillespie, 56, was gracious in defeat, taking to the stage at a hotel outside Richmond to congratulate Northam and pledging to help the new governor in any way he could. Gillespie never mentioned Trump during his concession speech, just as he almost never mentioned him on the campaign trail. But the president was quick to lash out earlier Tuesday as it became clear that Gillespie was losing. He was referring to the MS-13 street gang, which featured prominently in Gillespie ads raising fears of violence and illegal immigration. Preliminary exit poll results found 28 percent of voters identifying as liberals, up eight points from the 2013 governor's race and two points from last year, when Clinton won the state by five points. Democrats composed 41 percent of the electorate, up four points from 2013 and one point from last year. Republicans were 31 percent of the electorate, a record low in exit polling dating to 1996. African Americans accounted for 21 percent of voters, according to exit poll results, identical to their share in last year's presidential election and one point higher than in 2013. In total, nonwhite voters made up 33 percent of the electorate, the same as last year but up from 28 percent in the previous governor's race. Black voters favored Northam over Gillespie by a 73-point margin, while Hispanic voters favored Northam by 33 points. Democrats had worked feverishly in recent weeks to court African American voters, and former president Barack Obama held a rally with the ticket in Richmond last month. Obama also recorded a robo-call that went out Monday and Tuesday to encourage people to vote. As the national Democratic Party has wrestled with fractures in recent weeks, the Virginia party may have offered a lesson in how to move ahead. After former congressman Tom Perriello mounted a progressive challenge to Northam for the Democratic nomination and lost, he became a foot soldier for Northam in the general election. Northam also may have benefited from the historic number of Democrats who challenged Republican incumbents in House of Delegates races. Their presence on the ballot helped bring out voters in districts all over the state who otherwise might have had little interest in a nonpresidential election. Republicans, on the other hand, failed for most of the year to project the same kind of unity. Gillespie ran a restrained primary race and nearly lost to rival Corey Stewart, who fully embraced Trumpian bombast and made defending Confederate statues and fighting illegal immigration into central issues. After the primary, Stewart refused to endorse Gillespie unless the candidate adopted his hard-right agenda and style. Gillespie gradually leaned in that direction as it became clear that he needed to firm up his base, especially in rural areas, but Stewart never campaigned for him. The governor's race had been close in pre-election polling, and Northam had been criticized by some in his party for waging a subdued campaign at a time of high passion and sharp rhetoric. But Virginians turned out in large numbers on a day of patchy rain around the state as Northam and the Democrats relied on an increasingly efficient system for getting voters to the polls, especially in the more-populous parts of the state. Gillespie ultimately failed in his attempt to walk a very fine line, working for votes in a state where his party's president is deeply unpopular. But Gillespie made a late turn toward Trumpian tactics that seemed to energize his campaign, promising to defend Confederate heritage and airing ads that seemed to equate illegal immigrants with violent gangs. The Trump factor drove an unusual amount of national attention toward Virginia, whose election was one of only two statewide contests in the country. The other, in New Jersey, was not considered competitive, so Virginia became the proxy for the painful efforts by both major parties to find their way forward in the age of Trump. Pat Sullivan, Sarah Gibson, Rachel Chason, Antonio Olivo, Maria Sacchetti, Julie Zauzmer, Shira Stein, Jenna Portnoy, Scott Clement, Emily Guskin, Dana Hedgpeth and Kristen Griffith contributed to this report.

Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William) and John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan) have announced that they will not seek reelection next year. Now they are a rare breed. The increasingly partisan nature of the Senate is part of why Watkins announced last month that he will not run again. That is not so much the case for Colgan, 88, who has been trying to retire for three election cycles, only to have fellow Democrats talk him into staying each time. Both men are known to value problem-solving over politics and to buck their parties on occasion. While most Republicans opposed expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Watkins created a compromise plan, although it ultimately failed. When a standoff over Medicaid threatened to shut down state government last summer, Colgan joined Republicans in calling lawmakers back into session to pass a budget. The lawmakers come from districts where party loyalties have shifted since they first took office, surviving by dint of their personal popularity and moderate reputations. Colgan has held on in his increasingly red Prince William County district, as Watkins has in his now blue-leaning suburban Richmond turf. The nature of their districts could mean that voters will pick moderates to replace them. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William). At the same time, Reeves predicted that races for the two open seats will be fierce, given the closely divided Senate. Republicans have a 21-19 majority. After leaving office, some of those Senate Republicans have endorsed Democrats, including Terry McAuliffe last year in his successful run for governor. More recently, many of the Senate moderates have left, and control of the chamber has switched back and forth between Republicans and Democrats. And upon taking power, both parties started playing hardball, revamping committees and redrawing district lines to take maximum advantage. Protracted ideological battles have become more common within the chamber, with Colgan and Watkins sometimes bucking their parties to try to resolve the fights. A World War II pilot who founded the regional air carrier Colgan Air, Colgan joined the Senate in 1976. A Catholic, he has usually sided with the GOP on abortion issues. Colgan said he wanted to avert a potential government shutdown. Watkins, 67, is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who has represented his suburban Richmond district in the Senate since 1998. He served in the House for 16 years before that. He has opposed Medicaid-funded abortions except in cases of rape, incest, gross fetal abnormalities or when the life of the mother is at risk. But he sided with Democrats against a highly controversial 2012 bill that, before it was amended, would have required most women to undergo a vaginal ultrasound before an abortion. Further bucking Republicans, he also opposed the amended version that wound up mandating a medically useless test. The plan had just three Republican takers in the Senate and died in the House. It upset some Democrats, who counted him as an ally in the Medicaid fight. Watkins put the blame on both parties. he said. Comments The story must be told.

Democrat Danica Roem, a former journalist, is set to make history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a state legislature in the United States. Roem will be the first transgender member of the House of Delegates and will become the first out transgender person to win and serve in a state legislature, according to the Victory Fund, a political action committee that works to get openly LGBTQ people elected and has supported Roem. She says she has refused to accept money from Dominion Energy, which she says has too much influence over lawmakers. Roem started pursuing therapy to begin her gender transition when she was 28, and said in an interview with The Associated Press during the campaign that politics should be inclusive of all. She also argued that Marshall, who has served in the House since 1992, has spent too much time on social policy. A lightning rod for controversy, Marshall often drew the ire of even his own party. Roem, who sings in a metal band in her spare time, said she learned to listen to different perspectives and digest complicated policy as a reporter for the Gainesville Times and Prince William Times, skills she would bring to bear as a delegate.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

Terry McAuliffe said recently that electing Democrats to the state Senate will help him advance his agenda on items such as Medicaid expansion, gun control and education spending even with a Republican-controlled House. Polls closed at 7 p.m. The GOP had a narrow 21-19 advantage heading into Election Day, and a net gain of one seat for the Democrats would give them effective control of the chamber with the tie-breaking vote of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. Mr. McPike also had outspent Mr. Parrish by about 2-to-1 on TV ads through Nov. 2, according to a compilation by the Center for Public Integrity. The political action committee of Mr. McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, also spent heavily on the race, as well as others in the state. In another tight race, Republican Glen Sturtevant was battling Democrat Dan Gecker in the Richmond-area 10th Senate District to replace retiring GOP Sen. John C. Watkins in a contest Democrats had eyed as a prime pick-up opportunity. That race included Independent Marleen Durfee and Libertarian Carl Loser. Mr. McAuliffe had said that a net pick-up of one Senate seat would brighten the prospects for items on his agenda like Medicaid expansion, gun control and education spending. But even with the state Senate hanging in the balance, Mr. McAuliffe would still be limited by a solidly Republican House of Delegates, which was on track to easily remain in GOP hands. In 2012, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine waas elected with nearly 53 percent of the vote, but both Mr. McAuliffe in 2013 and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014 won with less than 50 percent of the vote.

Roem made transportation improvements, including widening lanes and removing stoplights on Route 28 in Centreville, a key part of her campaign.

Democrats also triumphed in the three statewide races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.

Ralph Northam (D). Two days after that eloquent bid for bipartisanship for the good of the commonwealth, Republicans responded. Their uncompromising answer: Not so much. In summarily rejecting a package of gun-control bills backed by Mr. Northam, a Republican-controlled Senate committee made clear it had no interest in working with the governor on his legislative priorities. That Virginia voters showed support for these initiatives by electing Mr. Northam didn't seem to matter. Voting largely along party lines, the Senate Courts of Justice Committee on Monday rejected a number of modest measures proposed by Democrats to combat gun violence. The legislation that was voted down included requiring background checks for all gun purchases, mandating that gun owners report lost or stolen weapons and allowing localities to ban firearms at permitted events. In addition to not listening to an electorate that gave Mr. Northam a landslide victory and elected other gun-control proponents in upset races, Senate Republicans also paid no heed to last year's violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville where the response of authorities was inhibited by the heavy presence of guns. Bills similar to those killed by the Senate are pending in the House. Time will soon tell. Mr. Northam, for his part, vowed not to give up. That Mr. Northam came under immediate criticism from Republicans for a campaign-style tone is pretty rich considering the success of his most recent campaign and the refusal of Republicans to recognize it by working him even a little bit on needed gun control.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

It was the culmination of last month's Democratic wave that had diminished Republican power in purple Virginia. Democrat Shelly Simonds emerged from the recount as the apparent winner in the 94th House District, seizing the seat from Republican David Yancey. A three-judge panel still must certify the results, an event scheduled for Wednesday. Of the 23,215 votes cast in the district on Election Day, Yancey held a lead of just 10 votes going into Tuesday's recount. The final tally: 11,608 for Simonds to 11,607 for Yancey. Power sharing in the House of Delegates is an awkward exercise; the last such arrangement was in 1998. Committee chairs have to be negotiated, as does the person who will serve as speaker. With the parties split 50-50, there is no mechanism to break ties, and any legislation short of 51 votes does not advance. Republicans hold a slight 21-to-19 edge in the state Senate, but with a Democratic lieutenant governor to break ties and a Democratic governor with veto power, Republicans may be forced to advance a more bipartisan agenda. It's a dramatic shift that caught even top Democrats by surprise. Republicans have controlled the 100-seat House since 2000; even outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a cheerleader for his party, had thought the Republican edge was insurmountable. But Democrats fired up by the election of Donald Trump as president turned out in big numbers on Election Day and ran as candidates in districts that hadn't seen Democratic challengers in years. Even election officials who had spent the day keeping order seemed rattled by the fact that such a momentous race could be settled in such dramatic fashion. The adage about how every vote counts is true, said Newport News Electoral Board Chairman Sean Devlin as he announced the official result. Both sides agreed that the recount went smoothly, but as the day wore on, the humdrum trickle of a vote here and a vote there began to build to high tension. Teams of recount officials sat at four tables in the center of the room with lawyers, the news media and other onlookers kept along two walls. Workers fed paper ballots into the machines one precinct at a time. Every time the machine couldn't read a vote, it spit out the ballot. Those ballots were examined to determine whether they carried a valid vote. Of the 23 precincts, plus absentee and provisional ballots, there were only about 200 to 250 ballots that had to be examined by hand, Devlin said. Hour by hour, as each precinct was completed, workers posted the results on a whiteboard. Reporters and observers squinted to read the board and calculate what was happening to the total. Just when it seemed Simonds was eating away Yancey's 10-vote margin, the Republican picked up a handful of votes to hold her off. Attorneys for both sides, seated next to each other, were loose and joking in the morning. But after a lunch break, the mood began to turn. With only three precincts left to count, Simonds had picked up 10 votes and Yancey had picked up four, preserving his lead. Then Simonds picked up a few more. With one precinct to go, they appeared to be even. By this time, he and the other lawyers were standing, pacing, talking in urgent tones into their cellphones. A shouting match erupted over whether the volunteer observers could talk to the election officials, and Devlin told the quarreling lawyers to quiet down or go outside. At 3 p.m., Devlin told all the officials and observers to take their seats. The room had gone nearly silent, with all but one precinct in and Simonds showing a one-vote lead. Twitter was in a frenzy, but the results still weren't final. At some point, word went around that the provisional ballots had changed nothing, and Simonds's one-vote margin seemed to stand. The attorneys for Yancey edged outside with their phones. By 3:20 p.m. Devlin announced the official results. He said he accepted the outcome. The system works. Simonds had been waiting outside as the recount wound down and said she wasn't going to celebrate until she had confirmation from the registrar. Yancey, who was in Richmond at a committee hearing, can contest the results of the election with the legislature, a step that veteran lawmakers last recall happening in 1979. But GOP officials said that seems unlikely. A GOP official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Republicans weren't quite sure what the process would be for choosing the next speaker. With the chamber tied, House Clerk G. Paul Nardo, as the only sitting officer of the House, will preside over the chamber until a speaker is elected. The speakership will go to whoever can get to 51 votes first. Gretchen Heal, Yancey's campaign manager and spokeswoman, left the recount without speaking to voters and did not immediately return a text message and email seeking comment. The final makeup of the legislature is not settled. Recounts in two additional races are taking place this week: on Wednesday in Richmond's District 68, where the Democrat leads by 336 votes, and on Thursday in Fredericksburg's District 28, where the Republican leads by 82 votes. Democrats are seeking a new election in the latter because more than 100 voters were mistakenly given ballots for the wrong legislative district.

Democrats also triumphed in the three statewide races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Bill Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Both candidates emphasize kitchen-table issues such as economic development and education. But sharp ideological differences were on display last week as they appeared at a candidate forum.

But in a post-election radio interview, he didn't offer a specific number when expressing support for raising the minimum wage. Illegal immigration issues Northam supports issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants in Virginia, as well as in-state tuition for students who were brought to the country illegally as children. That angered supporters on the left, who disrupted his Election Night victory speech. View Graphic Virginia general election guide Single-payer health care Northam has resisted calls in his party to support a government-run, single-payer health-care system, which have been louder outside of Virginia. While 11 Democratic House of Delegates candidates expressed support for single-payer, only one was elected: Lee Carter. Taxes Northam campaigned on overhauling Virginia's tax system, but said he would leave the details up to a bipartisan commission. Northam's only specific campaign tax proposal was phasing out sales taxes on groceries paid by low-income Virginians. Since his election, Northam also suggested exempting military pensions from state taxes. Higher education Northam's signature campaign policy proposal was offering free community college or apprenticeships to Virginians. It comes with several caveats: It's limited to those seeking training in high-demand fields including cybersecurity and early-childhood education, and would require a year of public service. Few campaign finance reform advocates see this as feasible, given how Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike benefit from corporate and large contributions. He also wants to end the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court fees, which critics says locks people into a cycle of poverty. Northam did not call for legalizing marijuana sales for recreational purposes, as is allowed in eight states. Voting rights Northam has backed a repeal of Virginia's requirement that voters present identification to cast ballots, and he wants to establish same-day voter registration and no-excuse early voting. But he hasn't called for automatic voter registration, which has been a priority for progressives nationwide. Northam also wants to standardize a process for restoring voting rights to felons who complete their sentences, building on outgoing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's work to restore rights to roughly 160,000. Now he says he wouldn't meddle with local decision-making. He touted the board of visitors at Virginia Military Institute, whose members he will appoint as governor, as an example of local decision-makers who grappled with a Confederate-era statue and chose to keep it up.

He also says he would oppose drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's coast. He also says he would support a dedicated funding source for WMATA, the regional transportation agency that runs Metro, but hasn't backed the regional sales tax favored by District leaders. But Republicans pressed Northam on whether his tune would change with a Democratic legislature. Democratic House leadership has expressed little interest in reversing the right-to-work law.

Thomas Jr. was selected to replace retiring GOP Speaker William J. Howell and in the 88th, incumbent Mark Cole (R-Spotsylvania) will return in January. At left is board member Edgardo Cortes and Vice-Chair Clara Bell Wheeler. Lawsuits, threats and recriminations are flying as the state wrestles with the tricky question of what to do about the 147 voters who were given the wrong ballots in and around a crucial district. Depending on what happens to that seat and two others, the 100-member House could fall into Democratic hands for the first time in nearly 20 years or find itself evenly divided and perhaps paralyzed. As in that race, determining an outcome could take several weeks and the intervention of the courts. The Republicans have gone from a commanding 66-34 majority in the House to an apparent 51-49 edge, with GOP candidates clinging to extraordinarily slim leads in three districts. In one of the hard-fought House districts, the 28th, in the Fredericksburg area about 50 miles south of Washington, Republican Bob Thomas leads Democrat Joshua Cole by just 82 votes. But the state elections commission recently found 147 voters in the district and neighboring ones cast their ballots in the wrong district. Exactly why they were assigned to the wrong districts is unclear, as the registrar responsible died in April. But Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes said it was probably an error by a registrar working with limited resources and antiquated equipment. He said Virginia has underfunded its election offices throughout the state and similar problems could exist in other districts. The Democrats rode a wave of anti-Trump voter sentiment to capture all three statewide offices and exceed all but the most optimistic predictions in the state House. Few expected the 28th to be close. Outgoing GOP House Speaker Bill Howell often faced no challenger in the district and won in 2015 by 20 points. On Monday, the Virginia Board of Elections voted to certify the results of the 28th, after the Democrats failed to get a federal court to delay action. Alcorn said state law left the board with little choice but that there were clear irregularities in the district and that he hopes the courts step in. Democratic House Leader David Toscano said his party is weighing its options. The Democrats have already filed a lawsuit in federal court in hopes of persuading a judge to order a new election in the 28th. GOP House Leader Kirk Cox, who is slated to be speaker should the Republicans maintain their majority, said he was disappointed the board held up certification by a week. The Democrats have until later this week to file requests for recounts in two other close races: in Newport News, where Republican David Yancey has a 10-vote lead, and in northern Virginia, where GOP candidate Tim Hugo is ahead by 106 votes. If the final result is a 50-50 split in the House, things could get even messier, and the two parties may have to compromise just to elect a speaker and assign committee chairmanships. The last time the House was evenly divided was 20 years ago, when the parties reached a power-sharing agreement. But if no agreement can be reached, prolonged chaos could ensue. All rights reserved.

If you've missed past diaries, follow these links: Day One, Competitive Districts. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. Day Five, Unchallenged Incumbents. Virginia Democrats may be depressed with the first part of this series, but this holiday season, they have a lot to be thankful for. In honor of this being New Year's Eve, we'll be looking at reasons to look forward to 2014. First, good girls and boys of all ages across Virginia have opened up their invitations to an inauguration featuring three Democratic officials. Combined with Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, the party has demonstrated that the far right is no longer welcome in statewide elections in the Commonwealth. In 2014, Mark Warner will be up for reelection and Virginia Republicans are desperate to find a warm body with a pulse to run against him. Right now, with concerns over the implementation of Obamacare, his numbers may be softer, but this will be temporary as the health care roll out improves in 2014. I question what Republican will be foolish enough to run; Warner will march onward to reelection. Even with a strong challenger, only delusional Tea Partiers believe Warner is truly vulnerable. Virginia Politics Twelve Days of Christmas for Virginia Democrats: Day Five, Unchallenged Incumbents FreeDem - December 30, 2013 10 This is the fifth part of a twelve part series looking at the challenges, obstacles, and future possibilities of Virginia Democrats. Here are the previous diaries: Day One, Competitive Districts. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. To show that you've read this diary and support the project, please vote in the poll at the end. On the fifth day of Christmas, the Commonwealth of Virginia gave to me ... Incumbents who are so safe in their seats they don't remember the last time they had to actually campaign. In 2013, 41 incumbent Delegates were not even challenged by another candidate, either by the other major party or by a minor party candidate. One more was able to win their first election without any challenge at all, walking right into office. That may seem sad, but it's an improvement over 2011, when 59 incumbents were unchallenged in their newly drawn districts. That's similar to elections in 2003, 2005, and 2007, where over 60 delegates on average, almost two-thirds of the chamber, were unchallenged. In the ten years from 2003 to 2013, well over half of all delegate races were unchallenged."}

Stewart, who nearly defeated Gillespie in the low-turnout primary, highlighted such polarizing issues as preserving Confederate monuments and targeting undocumented immigrants, a strategy that Gillespie used as polls appeared to show the two candidates in a close race. What it shows is that the same-old, same-old style of running campaigns doesn't work. Over the course of the campaign, Gillespie appeared to struggle with how closely he wanted to align himself with the president. Even after Trump endorsed him on Twitter, Gillespie did not acknowledge the president's support until he was asked about it by reporters. While he campaigned with Vice President Pence, Gillespie never appeared in public with the president. Virginia election results 2017: Live maps, analysis, complete updates View Graphic Tom Davis, the former GOP congressman who represented Northern Virginia, drew the opposite conclusion after Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) ran up huge margins Tuesday in counties such as Loudoun and Prince William. It motivated the Democratic base. Democrats came out en masse in protest. Once a reliable Republican bastion, the commonwealth turned purple as President Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012, victories driven by a growing and diversifying population in Northern Virginia. Another sign of the state's shift leftward was when Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) defeated Republican Ken Cuccinelli II in 2013, breaking a streak of nine elections in which the party controlling the White House lost the governor's race. The signs of Republican frustration over the state's transformation were evident last night on social media after the results came in. Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, appeared to blame the loss on the dominance of the suburbs outside Washington. But with Democrats surpassing expectations in Virginia's legislative races last night, Republicans said the party needs to reassess the message it is conveying to voters. Voters are sending a message to Republicans that they have to get their act together. People want results, not just rhetoric. Rep. Scott W. Taylor (R-Va.) said that his party's acerbic tone and its embrace of polarizing issues drove up Democratic turnout, which hurt the Republicans. And if I don't agree with him, I'll say it. And I think that contributed to a very high turnout on the Democrat side this time in Virginia. We need to get back to the business of government.

West Virginia has a great story on elections security that is rooted in response to the 2016 elections, which caught election officials nationwide flat footed. While certain institutions wrung their hands on how to start, West Virginia relied on our pioneer spirit and plotted our own course into unchartered territory. We insisted on security clearances, sought assistance from our National Guard, attended conferences at Harvard, and inspected polling places and elections storage facilities. We sent field representatives to every county and began working closely with all 55 county clerks. As knowledge of the threat became known, our staff helped write the protocols on how to defend against the threats, how to counter the threats, and how to respond to attacks. This conference had two objectives: 1) to train the clerks on cybersecurity; and 2) to begin the application and allocation process for distribution of federal funds for election security. Masterton took lessons learned from West Virginia to share with other states. Attendees at the conference participated in a day-long mock election preparation and Election Day scenario that gave attendees practical experience on issues that could pop up unexpectedly. Clerks were extremely well pleased with the quality of the training, as well as the opportunity to obtain federal funding for local elections. As for election security, we already have in place a voter verified paper trail that is mandated on all voting equipment. Pre-election logic and accuracy tests of every tabulation device is performed publically before every election. Post-election audits are performed randomly in each county to ensure the paper records match the electronic results. As Secretary of State, I have taken an active role in improving specific cybersecurity measures. West Virginia was the first state to distribute these materials to county clerks and all 582 West Virginia candidates registered to run for office in 2018. Also, we are now members of the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, another communication channel to prevent cybersecurity threats against protected systems. When DHS named elections as Critical Infrastructure (CI), I became one of a handful of Secretaries of State who served on the Government Coordinating Council to draft the protocols for this new CI sector. Almost one year ago today, Major General James Hoyer of the West Virginia National Guard (WVNG) and I forged an advanced partnership that has since resulted in a full-time Guard member with Top Secret clearance to monitor state-level cyber activity and give my office election security recommendations. Our West Virginia National Guard conducted vulnerability testing on election systems prior to the 2018 midterm primary at no additional expense to either agency. This advanced partnership is the first instance in the country to imbed a National Guard member in the elections arena as a cyber-expert, and our approach is serving as a model for other states as they increase their election security posture. I have also made it a priority to make additional funds available to county clerks and local election officials to improve voting technology. We intend to have the money distributed quickly so counties can increase security prior to the General Election in November. We also have funds available to help address ADA needs for polling locations. I will do everything in my power to secure, defend and protect the foundation of American democracy -- our republic depends on secure elections. WV Secretary of State Mac Warner is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and the WVU College of Law. Prior to being elected Secretary of State, he served 23 years in the United States Army retiring as Lt. Colonel. As a result, one or more Web Part properties may contain confidential information.

But why she moved 83 voters from one Virginia House of Delegates district to another, no one seems to know. Former Fredericksburg registrar Juanita Pitchford cannot say. She died in April. But the adjustments she made in the 28th and 88th districts live on, throwing two House seats and control of the entire chamber into highly litigated limbo nearly three weeks after Election Day. Precisely 83 voters were initially said to have been moved out of a district won by a margin of 82 votes, although after a few days' investigation, election officials said they had uncovered hundreds of misassigned voters between the two districts. They say 147 of them voted in the wrong district. Perhaps adding to the confusion: The 28th and the 88th races each had a candidate with the last name Cole, one a Democrat, the other a Republican. It would all be one big knee-slapper if the stakes weren't so high. Control of the state's lower chamber hangs in the balance. Republicans boasted a 66-to-34 majority going into this month's elections. Now the count is 49 Democrats and 51 Republicans, including the two uncertified races. If those two delegates are not seated, the parties would be tied at 49 apiece. Voter confidence could be especially tested if a losing candidate files a challenge with the state legislature, with the winner decided by a House vote, observers say. An election challenge in the legislature would be a rare but not unprecedented means of settling a Virginia General Assembly race. Democrats and their allies have filed three lawsuits to try to block the State Board of Elections from certifying the 28th and 88th District races. Two of the suits were promptly dismissed. In the third case, a federal judge rejected Democrats' request for a temporary restraining order to block the state board from certifying the 28th District election when it meets Monday. But he left open the possibility of a special election. At that hearing in federal court, state officials said, they had discovered a total of 384 misassigned voters between the two House districts. But over the weekend, state elections officials indicated that 147 of the misassigned voters cast ballots. Elections officials said the trouble began on Charles Street, in a heavily Democratic precinct where in 2016, 68 percent voters went for Hillary Clinton and 27 percent went for President Trump. The whole street should be in the 28th District. He was at a loss to explain why. There has been some pushback on the rogue registrar theory, with several people suggesting Pitchford could not have acted alone. Her daughter, Aliya Wong, said the registrar had plenty of supervision. In the 88th District, Del. But if Mark Cole's race remains uncertified, and he is not seated when the legislature convenes in January, Democrats could use the vacancy to help them gain control of a chamber that the GOP has long dominated. Democrats could take power if recounts produce a win in two other close races. Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) has a 106-vote lead over Democrat Donte Tanner, while Del. David E. Yancey (R-Newport News) is up just 10 votes over Democrat Shelly Simonds. A losing candidate could contest the results in the House, something Saslaw, one of Virginia's longest-serving legislators, recalls happening just once before. In 1979, Republican Meyera Oberndorf challenged her loss in a Senate race, which she blamed on malfunctioning voting machines. With the Senate under Democratic control, she got nowhere.

Republican Robert Thomas beat Democrat Joshua Cole by 82 votes on Nov. 7 in a contest to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). But the outcome, which could affect which party leads the chamber, is in dispute because of errors that led 147 voters to cast ballots in the wrong race. Democrats on Wednesday filed an amended complaint, updating a lawsuit filed Nov. 21 in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. The original suit, filed on behalf of three voters who were denied the chance to vote in the proper race, sought a temporary restraining order to stop Virginia's Board of Elections from certifying the results of 28th District House race. U.S. Judge T.S. Ellis III denied that request but did not dismiss the suit, allowing for Wednesday's filing. Members said they were required by state law to certify the results despite irregularities and were powerless to require any available remedies, such as ordering a new election. They also said that certification was necessary before other challenges, such as a recount, could begin. The amended complaint asks the judge to order the state to decertify the election and to block Thomas from being seated as a delegate when the General Assembly convenes in January. Parker Slaybaugh, spokesman for Del. M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights), who is in line to become speaker if Republicans hold the majority, said House Republicans were dismayed by the filing. A date for that recount has not been officially set but Democrats and Republicans say it is likely to take place Dec. 21. G. Manoli Loupassi (R-Richmond) lost to Democrat Dawn Adams by 336 votes. That recount is scheduled for Dec. 20. Now the count is 49 Democrats and 51 Republicans. Democrats, who also swept statewide offices for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general, need one more House win to force a power-sharing deal with Republicans and two more to take control of the chamber for the first time since 2000.

Astrid Riecken Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Gregory S. Schneider , Reporter Laura Vozzella , Reporter Fenit Nirappil , Reporter November 8, 2017 Democrat Ralph Shearer Northam won a hard-fought race to become Virginia's 73rd governor, beating Republican Ed Gillespie in an election watched around the nation as a judgment on President Trump and the politics of polarization. Voters chose Northam, the lieutenant governor, 54 percent to 45 percent over Gillespie as part of a stunning Democratic sweep of statewide offices, including lieutenant governor and attorney general. There also were widespread Democratic victories in the House of Delegates. The vote had national resonance as well. Gillespie, in turn, had dipped into Trump's playbook with strong law-and-order messages, but tried to keep his distance from the president in a state that now leans blue. Social media reaction Wednesday framed the Virginia governor's contest as a bellwether of the sentiments across the country, as some people predicted it was also a sign that the GOP faces big trouble ahead. Many voters said they were simply relieved that the election and its ads were over. Democrats at the Northam campaign party in Fairfax City broke into tears as results came in Tuesday evening, the outcome beyond what most had dared hope. For all the fury unleashed on the Virginia races by Trump and his followers, who lit up social media and tried to define the contests in terms of Confederate statues and Hispanic street gangs, Northam had seemed an unlikely standard-bearer to fight back. Even some fellow Democrats had criticized Northam for his low-key campaign style. But in the end, he won more votes than any previous Virginia governor, and it was a historic night for the party across many fronts. Voters energized by last fall's demoralizing loss by Hillary Clinton came out in large numbers to elect Democrat Justin Fairfax as lieutenant governor over Republican state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Fauquier), making Fairfax the first African American elected to a statewide office in Virginia since L. Douglas Wilder won as governor in 1989. Democratic Attorney General Mark R. Herring was reelected over Republican challenger John Adams. And Democrats were poised to pick up at least 14 seats in the House of Delegates after fielding a historic number of challengers, many of them women. Among them is Danica Roem, who defeated longtime Republican incumbent Robert G. Marshall in Prince William County to become the first openly transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature. Six more House seats were in play as of late Tuesday, with four of those headed for recounts. The Democrats needed to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the House of Delegates. That would be a stunning turnaround in a body where Republicans had a seemingly insurmountable 66-to-34 advantage. All 100 seats were up for election. Whether you voted for me or not, we are all Virginians. As he has traveled the country, McAuliffe said, the pressure from other Democrats to perform in this election has been enormous. The victors basked in the idea that they had just shown something to the nation. Gillespie, 56, was gracious in defeat, taking to the stage at a hotel outside Richmond to congratulate Northam and pledging to help the new governor in any way he could. Gillespie never mentioned Trump during his concession speech, just as he almost never mentioned him on the campaign trail. But the president was quick to lash out earlier Tuesday as it became clear that Gillespie was losing. He was referring to the MS-13 street gang, which featured prominently in Gillespie ads raising fears of violence and illegal immigration. Preliminary exit poll results found 28 percent of voters identifying as liberals, up eight points from the 2013 governor's race and two points from last year, when Clinton won the state by five points. Democrats composed 41 percent of the electorate, up four points from 2013 and one point from last year. Republicans were 31 percent of the electorate, a record low in exit polling dating to 1996. African Americans accounted for 21 percent of voters, according to exit poll results, identical to their share in last year's presidential election and one point higher than in 2013. In total, nonwhite voters made up 33 percent of the electorate, the same as last year but up from 28 percent in the previous governor's race. Black voters favored Northam over Gillespie by a 73-point margin, while Hispanic voters favored Northam by 33 points. Democrats had worked feverishly in recent weeks to court African American voters, and former president Barack Obama held a rally with the ticket in Richmond last month. Obama also recorded a robo-call that went out Monday and Tuesday to encourage people to vote. As the national Democratic Party has wrestled with fractures in recent weeks, the Virginia party may have offered a lesson in how to move ahead. After former congressman Tom Perriello mounted a progressive challenge to Northam for the Democratic nomination and lost, he became a foot soldier for Northam in the general election. Northam also may have benefited from the historic number of Democrats who challenged Republican incumbents in House of Delegates races. Their presence on the ballot helped bring out voters in districts all over the state who otherwise might have had little interest in a nonpresidential election. Republicans, on the other hand, failed for most of the year to project the same kind of unity. Gillespie ran a restrained primary race and nearly lost to rival Corey Stewart, who fully embraced Trumpian bombast and made defending Confederate statues and fighting illegal immigration into central issues. After the primary, Stewart refused to endorse Gillespie unless the candidate adopted his hard-right agenda and style. Gillespie gradually leaned in that direction as it became clear that he needed to firm up his base, especially in rural areas, but Stewart never campaigned for him. The governor's race had been close in pre-election polling, and Northam had been criticized by some in his party for waging a subdued campaign at a time of high passion and sharp rhetoric. But Virginians turned out in large numbers on a day of patchy rain around the state as Northam and the Democrats relied on an increasingly efficient system for getting voters to the polls, especially in the more-populous parts of the state. Gillespie ultimately failed in his attempt to walk a very fine line, working for votes in a state where his party's president is deeply unpopular. But Gillespie made a late turn toward Trumpian tactics that seemed to energize his campaign, promising to defend Confederate heritage and airing ads that seemed to equate illegal immigrants with violent gangs. The Trump factor drove an unusual amount of national attention toward Virginia, whose election was one of only two statewide contests in the country. The other, in New Jersey, was not considered competitive, so Virginia became the proxy for the painful efforts by both major parties to find their way forward in the age of Trump.

Count that as a new low for hyper-partisanship, dirty tricks and the unaccountable arrogance of power. The Republican move was executed in the style of a putsch, arising from a conspiracy and with no warning, public input or debate. Pressing their momentary numerical superiority, GOP lawmakers amended a routine House bill by tacking on a new map, devised in secret. Mr. McDonnell should immediately announce his intention to veto the map. If the redistricting is allowed to stand, it would radically reshape politics in Richmond. Unlike the GOP-dominated House of Delegates, the Senate has been in Democratic hands or closely divided since 2007. The Republican gerrymander, which could deliver several seats to the GOP, would change that at a stroke. That this change would take place at mid-decade, rather than immediately following the decennial census as is customary, is of no concern to the Republicans, whose eyes are fixed only on the 2015 legislative elections. In embracing the radical option, they discounted all consequences, including the hypocrisy of their chosen fig leaf. State Sen. John C. Watkins (Chesterfield), the mastermind of the ruse, defended it on the grounds that it would likely yield one additional black state senator. That rationale was rich, given that Republicans have steadfastly blocked Democratic attempts to redraw the electoral map for Congress to create additional minority districts. Shame on the witless Democrats for not anticipating that Republicans, given the chance, would resort to dirty tricks. And shame on Republicans for continuing their campaign to transform the General Assembly into a nasty, underhanded clone of Congress. They could also block passage of the budget.

John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) has occupied since 1996, could determine which party controls the Senate and whether Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has sway with the legislature in the remaining two years of his term. It also will show whether Democrats in this key presidential swing state can maintain a foothold in the region. Even some Democrats who think Edwards is safe say the district has grown more challenging. Republicans are trying to knock off Edwards, a former Marine and U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, with Nancy Dye, a businesswoman, civic leader and retired surgeon. His bid is widely considered a long shot, but he could play the role of spoiler in a tight race. All 140 legislative seats are up for grabs in November, but with the House of Delegates firmly in Republican control, most of the attention is on the Senate, where Republicans enjoy a 21-19 majority. Democrats have to hold onto all of their seats and pick up one more to make it a tie and take control. Democrats would be in charge of a 20-20 Senate, because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) presides over the chamber and has the power to break most ties. Four of the six senators elected to represent the Southwest that year were on his side of the aisle. He is one of just two west of Charlottesville, the other being Sen. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath). All gun rights supporters, they spoke on broad themes without drawing sharp policy distinctions. Edwards touted his long tenure in Richmond. Dye highlighted her experience outside of politics. Caldwell said he would have leverage as an independent in a closely divided Senate, parlaying his crucial swing vote into gains for the region. The 21st Senate District was drawn with a pronounced hook, which makes it resemble an inverted Cape Cod and allows it to take in the deep-blue city of Roanoke and the area around Virginia Tech. Thanks to the city and Tech votes, the district has remained reliably Democratic even as other parts of it have grown redder like the rest of Southwest Virginia. When Warner narrowly won reelection to the U.S. Senate last year, it was no thanks to most of the Southwest, which rejected the former governor by double-digit margins. Democrats have been losing support in the rural South since the 1960s, but what had been a long, slow slide seemed to reach a tipping point around 2010, leaving the party with little or no sway in those regions, said Virginia Tech political science assistant professor Jason P. Kelly. He noted that Democrat Rick Boucher, who had represented Southwest Virginia in Congress since 1983, lost his seat that year to Morgan Griffith (R). The trend coincides with the rise of the tea party, but Kelly said they had not yet delved into what is driving it. Edwards easily won his most recent election, in 2011, beating well-funded Republican Dave Nutter with 56 percent of the vote. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) looks at those results and sees an easy win for Edwards. But Republicans say they have a good shot with Dye, who lives in Roanoke and has long been active in city schools and local charities. Comments The story must be told.

Low 73F. Winds WSW at 10 to 15 mph. The House of Delegates retained its strong Republican majority, and the Senate remains in GOP control, 21-19, meaning McAuliffe must continue to work with a legislature of the other party. And although the status quo survives in state government, the focus shifts to 2016, when McAuliffe hopes to deliver Virginia for Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the presidential race. The GOP kept its Senate majority by holding onto a Richmond-area seat. Republican Glen Sturtevant will replace retiring GOP Sen. John Watkins in the 10th District. The GOP also successfully defended a hotly contested seat in Virginia Beach. Sen. Frank Wagner defeated Democratic challenger Gary McCollum in a nasty and expensive race. Democrats all year expressed confidence they'd win the Senate, and they had star power behind them. They hold all five statewide elected offices in Virginia, and their party leader has touted himself as a job-creating governor. But in the final days of the campaign, Republicans attacked Democrats in Northern Virginia over tolls. And some observers questioned why McAuliffe emphasized gun control as he did. U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, Attorney General Mark Herring and Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam joined McAuliffe on the campaign trail in the past few days. But early on Tuesday, Democratic Party of Virginia press secretary Morgan Finkelstein began lowering expectations, sending reporters a bulletin saying Democrats always had faced an uphill battle. That's not the spin Democrats were using all year. In Northern Virginia, Republicans campaigned against a McAuliffe proposal to establish a toll on Interstate 66. The toll plan is just for solo drivers who choose to pay it to use HOV lanes during peak times inside the Capital Beltway. In Prince William County's 29th Senate District, Republican Hal Parrish, the mayor of Manassas, used the toll issue against Democrat Jeremy McPike, prompting McAuliffe in a radio interview to call Parrish a liar. Parrish and McPike vied to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Chuck Colgan, whose family endorsed longtime friend Parrish. The Colgan seat and the Richmond area's 10th District were the two hottest races in the final weeks of the election. In the 10th, Democrat Dan Gecker faced the GOP's Sturtevant, a member of the Richmond School Board. Democrats had been convinced they could win the seat. Even had Democrats won the Senate, they still would have faced opposition to the governor's signature proposals in the conservative House, where Republicans dominate 2 to 1 and Democratic bills are quickly killed in committees. Democrats set a goal for themselves and came up short, he said. Republicans increased the number of GOP women in the Senate from one to three. Siobhan Dunnavant of Henrico County, three of whose brothers are elected officials in Virginia Beach, was elected in the 12th District. Dunnavant is the sister of Virginia Beach Sheriff Ken Stolle, Del. Chris Stolle and Commonwealth's Attorney Colin Stolle. She replaces retiring Republican Sen. Walter Stosch. In the 11th District, Amanda Chase of Chesterfield County beat her Democratic opponent after defeating GOP Sen. Steve Martin in the June primary. In a closely watched race in the Roanoke area, Democratic Sen. John Edwards held his seat against Republican challenger Nancy Dye and independent Don Caldwell. Only 38 of 100 House seats had more than one candidate on the ballot. In the Senate, 23 of 40 races were contested. McAuliffe now faces two more years of GOP control of the General Assembly as he finishes the second half of his term. He'll soon introduce a two-year budget that will outline his priorities.

Virginia Voters Deserve Better House Democratic Leader David J. Toscano (Medium Post) The 2017 Virginia House of Delegates elections were truly historic. In picking up 15 seats, Democrats made gains not seen since the 1880s. Now, House Democrats are knocking on the door of the majority, but two things are holding us back. Virginia voters deserve better. Virginians believe strongly in their fundamental right to vote for their preferred candidates when electing their representatives. Every vote should be counted and every vote should count. Yet in House District 28, 147 voters were given the wrong ballot and were therefore disenfranchised from casting a vote in the district in which they live. After a recount, Democrat Joshua Cole is only 73 votes behind his Republican opponent, less than one-half the number of the votes not counted in the proper district. We hear over and over from Republicans about alleged voter fraud, but here is a case in which our Department of Elections has concluded that real, identifiable voters were actually disenfranchised. The only real solution to this problem is to hold a new election in which all voters in HD-28 can receive correct ballots and vote for the candidate of their choice. The Republican response to this call has been outright resistance. Respect for the Constitution and the rule of law both suggest that Republicans should join Democrats in a call for a new election. Virginians deserve better. In Newport News, the situation is even more bizarre. Democrat Shelly Simonds won here in a recount by one vote, with both Republicans and Democrats signing off on the result. The next day, the Republicans decided to violate the rules and throw a Hail Mary pass designed to convince local judges to count an additional ballot in their favor, with no legal justification and no advance notice to opposing counsel. A similar request by the Democrats was then rejected, the recount total was redone, and the race is suddenly tied. Our historic gains in the House of Delegates were a resounding rejection of the toxic, Trumpian rhetoric and policies that defined the Republican strategy both up and down the ballot this year. Virginians in this election spoke loudly and clearly that they wanted new leadership and new ways of thinking about politics, and Democrats won because we are committed to giving this to them. Their voices should not be silenced by tainted elections or games of chance. This piece by House Democratic Leader David J. Toscano is posted to Medium.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

On day three, we were visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past to teach us the lessons of past campaign mistakes. As we know from day one, the Republican gerrymander isn't the only problem facing Virginia Democrats in the House of Delegates. But the gerrymandering's impact has negatively influenced Democratic recruits for higher office outside of Northern Virginia."}

Here are a few highlights from the speech (bolding added by me for emphasis). Not everybody has great relationships with their dad, so put a picture of your mother or your grandparents or people who when you were young and needed to learn from an adult, they were the people who raised you, who taught you, who loved you, who cared for you. Because we have a president right now who is tearing apart families who are coming to seek refuge in this country. Last November, we gave the nation a hope injection in a difficult time, in the aftermath of that shocking and controversial election in 2016, in the aftermath of the brutal white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August of 2017. We, all of us, we stood together in Virginia. You did that. We can be at our best and win House seats, with our four great incumbents, with our seven great challengers, six of whom are women. We can move forward to make sure that Virginia keeps on the path of progress, innovation and equality. My opponent in this race says his goal is to run the most ruthless and vicious campaign that Virginia has ever seen. My opponent wants to slash Medicaid and take health insurance away from tens of millions of people by repealing the Affordable Care Act. My opponent says he will only support judges who want to overturn Roe vs. Wade. My opponent wants to eliminate the Department of Education and he has a track record of underfunding public schools. My opponent calls climate change a hoax. My opponent is fine with tax cuts for corporations but has a record of raising taxes repeatedly on regular people and families. My opponent has demonized and bashed immigrants throughout his career, instead of recognizing the hard work and values that new Americans bring to our diverse and growing state. And of course my opponent likes to praise and encourage white supremacists, those who organize hate-filled rallies like the tragedy in Charlottesville and perpetrate online filth and anti-Semitism. This week, the American press was filled with stories about his bizarre connections to spreaders of hate. And Israeli newspapers were filled with articles about his ties to notorious anti-Semites. We are a Commonwealth and that means we are a community we believe in equality. We are a state for lovers, not a state for haters.

Terry McAuliffe. It is a big defeat for McAuliffe, a close ally for Hillary Clinton, and a big defeat for New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who donated heavily to Democrats in the hope of winning the Virginia electoral fights on a promise of more gun-control. Republicans beat back two serious challengers Tuesday, holding onto seats in the suburbs of Richmond and the Hampton Roads area. In another hotly contested race, Republican Hal Parrish holds a lead over Democrat Jerry McPike. If Parrish holds onto his lead, it would represent a Republican gain, as the two are battling to replace a retiring Democrat. McAuliffe, with considerable help from Bloomberg, bet his political capital on Democrats winning the upper Chamber. But he seems to have fallen far short. Republicans currently hold a 2-seat majority in the state Senate. Republicans have an overwhelming majority in the state House. Bloomberg was hoping to capitalize on the tragic shooting of two Virginia TV reporters by a disgruntled newsman earlier this Summer. He pumped millions into the race for two critical state Senate seats. As a result, both Democrats were able to dramatically outspend their Republican rivals. Bloomberg and his SuperPAC, Everytown for Gun Safety, hoped to show that Democrats could win on the issue of gun control. Also, Gov. McAuliffe had made enacting new restrictions on gun ownership a centerpiece of his campaigning for Democrats around the state. McAuliffe also campaigned aggressively for expanding Medicaid through ObamaCare and implementing universal preschool. Barred from running for reelection, McAuliffe will now face a united Republican legislature for his final two years in office. In many ways, this legislative election turned on issues central to her campaign."}
{"URL_s":"https://wtop.com/virginia/2015/10/6-things-to-know-for-virginias-nov-3-election/","Timestamp_s":"20180819002359","Sentences_t":"This is an off-year election for Virginia with no statewide or congressional races and turnout is expected to be low. But the results could have a significant impact on policy decisions at both the state and local level. WTOP Northern Virginia reporter Max Smith explains what voters need to know before heading to the polls. 1. Control of the Virginia Senate After a series of swings in recent years, Republicans enter the election in control of the Senate by a 21-19 margin. Because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has the tie-breaking vote, Democrats would need to pick up just one seat to gain control of the chamber. Although all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are also up for election this cycle, Republicans are expected to easily maintain their large majority in the chamber, allowing them to challenge many proposals from Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, regardless of which party has a majority in the Senate. One of the two key races in Northern Virginia is projected to be in the 29th Senate District, centered around Manassas. Democrat Jeremy McPike faces Republican Hal Parrish for a seat left open by the retirement of Democrat Sen. Chuck Colgan. Colgan has represented Manassas, Manassas Park and parts of Prince William County since 1976. The other key race in Northern Virginia has generated heated attacks in parts of Prince William and Loudoun counties, where Republican Sen. Dick Black is running for reelection. Jill McCabe is the Democratic candidate. Races elsewhere in the state, including Roanoke and parts of the Eastern Shore and Hampton Roads, could also determine which party will control the state Senate. Read more about the Senate races here. 2. Handful of House races While district lines drawn to protect many incumbents have made the overall makeup of the House of Delegates nearly a foregone conclusion, there are a handful of local House races that challengers hope will be competitive. Voters in Western Fairfax and Eastern Loudoun counties will choose a new delegate to represent the 86th District, an area served for seven terms by retiring Republican Tom Rust. Voters in Eastern Loudoun County will also choose a new delegate to replace Republican David Ramadan, who opted not to seek another term representing the 87th District. 3. Local leaders Also on the ballot will be races for the top posts in local communities including the city of Alexandria plus Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties. The Alexandria race for mayor is among the least predictable in what is expected to be a low-turnout election. Current Mayor Bill Euille lost a Democratic primary challenge to Vice Mayor Allison Silberberg. But he has since launched a write-in campaign against her. The four-way race for Loudoun County Board chair is potentially equally interesting. Current Chairman Scott York is running as an independent, after initially announcing plans to leave the board. He re-entered the race after the supervisor he endorsed to replace him, Shawn Williams, ended his own campaign for chair and resigned from the board following revelations of alcohol issues, a violent confrontation with a former girlfriend and a misdemeanor arrest. York leads in fundraising, followed by King, Randall and Bellanca, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. 4. Local boards and councils In addition to the chairman posts on each county board, district supervisor seats are also on the ballot in counties across the region. In Fairfax County, voters will fill the seats of two long-serving supervisors who are retiring. Supervisor Gerry Hyland has represented the Mount Vernon District since 1987 and Michael Frey has represented the Sully District since 1990. In Loudoun and Prince William counties, development, county spending, traffic and safety issues top the debate in several supervisor races. All seats on the Arlington board are at-large. In Alexandria, all six city council seats are also on the ballot. 5. School board and constitutional offices Voters will also choose non-partisan candidates for school boards. Virginia only lists party affiliations on the ballot for General Assembly, statewide and federal races. That means voters who may otherwise rely on party affiliation must do their research before heading to the polls. Recent decisions like new school start times, salaries and curriculum are among the issues up for debate in some races. 6. How to vote Polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 3. Voters who forget to bring identification with them can cast a provisional ballot that will be counted as long as they present a copy of a valid photo ID to the local electoral board by noon on the Friday following the election. Virginia voters who meet one of a long list of requirements, including a commute and workday that lasts 11 hours or more, can vote absentee either by mail or in person. The deadline to apply for a mail-in absentee ballot is Oct. 27. The state just unveiled a form allowing voters to apply for the ballot online. In-person absentee voting continues through Saturday, Oct. 31 at designated locations in each community. All Rights Reserved.

Here are the highlights of yesterday's results. Kentucky Governor In what was probably the most high-profile race on tap, Republican Matt Bevin earned a gubernatorial takeover for the red team. The significance of this election was not just the victory by the Tea Party 'outsider,' but the near-landslide margin. His 53-44 advantage reveals how strong the GOP is, at least in Kentucky, and how wrong the polls were. Before the election, not one Kentucky governor poll gave Bevin the lead. We'll see how that translates to Louisiana in a couple weeks, but if I'm John Bel Edwards, I'm feeling less confident today. Mississippi Governor As expected, Republican incumbent Phil Bryant breezed to an easy win. He outpaced Democrat and truck driver Robert Gray by a 2-1 margin. Virginia State Senate Democrats had hoped to earn at least a tie in the Virginia state Senate. Before voting started, the GOP enjoyed a 21-19 advantage. The blue team's hopes for a tie, which would have resulted in control of the chamber due to the Lt. Governor's deciding Democratic vote, looked encouraging early on. But late returns from very conservative Powhatan County brought the Republican candidate in District 10 back from a significant deficit and kept the Senate in GOP hands. Pennsylvania Supreme Court On a day Democrats fell disappointed at almost every turn, the Keystone State provided a welcome respite. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court currently has 2 Democrats and 3 Republicans, including an interim justice, and 2 vacant seats. With a Democratic sweep of the three seats up for grabs yesterday, Democrats will enjoy a 5-2 majority going forward. The emphatic 2-1 margin comes as a relief to those who felt the measure would endanger women and girls. Ohio Marijuana The Buckeye State chose not to join a growing number of states which have legalized marijuana use. Ohioans turned down that prospect by a 64-36 no vote. Overall, it was a very good night for Republicans and conservatives. Bevin's victory in Kentucky came as a surprise considering pre-election polling. It leaves a prognosticator like me wondering how to deal with polling numbers in making my projections."}

Here are the previous diaries: Day One, Competitive Districts. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. In 2013, 41 incumbent Delegates were not even challenged by another candidate, either by the other major party or by a minor party candidate. One more was able to win their first election without any challenge at all, walking right into office. In the ten years from 2003 to 2013, well over half of all delegate races were unchallenged. Previous Republican Delegate Sam Nixon had held the district uncontested since winning it in a special election in 1994. When the 27th became open during a special election in 2010, the Democratic Party ignored the district and instead devoted resources to a more Republican district in Harrisonburg. At the time, the 27th was a district where Barack Obama had won. Instead, we are not even competing. We need to find ways to contest every district, especially every competitive district. However, many of these candidates in long-shot races are going to be running bare bone campaigns with little outside support. They need to live off the land, getting the resources they can from the local community. An assortment of other Democrats running in more conservative areas ran slightly ahead, including Cathcart, Harris, Cyphert, and Daniel. None were in districts that could ever be competitive without a blue moon, and then some. Only Qarni kept his race against Bob Marshall close in a competitive district, almost pulling off an upset when few gave him a chance. Cyphert and Qarni were running against the most outspoken of social theocrats in Richmond. The logical explanation is that in these overwhelmingly Republican seats, the incumbent hardly has to campaign, and so the more intrepid underdog can pick off a few crossover votes. But in marginal districts, the challenge to the incumbent Republican awakens a sleeping giant. The response from the GOP campaign apparatus smacks aside the challenger, ensuring enough crossover support from Democratic voters to protect themselves. However, not every Democratic challenger in the long-shot races ran better than McAuliffe. In many other Republican districts, the Democratic challenger ran behind the top of the ticket.

Partly cloudy skies after midnight. Low 69F. Winds light and variable. Fewer than half of contests for the state legislature will have more than one candidate, and only a small percentage of contested races are expected to be close. In the state Senate, 22 out of 40 races have more than one candidate, but only six are expected to be close. In the House, only 38 out of 100 have two or more candidates, with only a handful expected to be competitive. The chief architect of the 2011 Republican legislative redistricting plan testified in federal court earlier this year that raw political self-interest was at work when the maps were being drawn. Del. S. Chris Jones testified that he tried to accommodate requests from 75 to 80 delegates who sought to tweak lines, sometimes to draw out precincts where they had historically performed poorly or to draw out a potential primary challenger. But those requests were made by Republicans and Democrats alike, and GOP lawmakers dispute that the current map is squelching competition. Republican Del. Greg Habeeb said there are many factors that explain the lack of competition, and a lack of effort by the Democratic Party to recruit candidates is one of them. He noted that Republicans currently control more than a dozen House districts that President Barack Obama won in 2012. Under the Byrd machine, legislative lines were drawn to favor rural districts over urban areas and often had to be redrawn under court order, Heinemann said. Democrats were hoping for a similar outcome based on the same legal arguments involving the state House districts, but a different panel of federal judges recently ruled 2 to 1 that the current state House districts were legal. The plaintiffs in the case have filed notice with the U.S. Supreme Court that they intend to file an appeal. A third redistricting lawsuit was filed in state court in September by a nonprofit group alleging that 11 House and Senate districts need be redrawn because they are not compact, which state law requires.

Day one focused on challenges facing Virginia Democrats in competitive districts, day two focused on problems with turnout. On day three, we were visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past to teach us the lessons of past campaign mistakes. I use this threshold because we saw how important it was in determining safe Democratic seats. After redistricting this was slashed down to 33 seats. Though Democrats won it in 2013, it will be a difficult district to hold until demographics catch up. But if Futrell can hang on in 2015 I think he could be set for the rest of the decade. This gets many incumbents to at least 2017, if not beyond, when another Republican gerrymandering may save them again. Ramadan won the seat by 51 votes in 2011 and then 195 votes in 2013. Not only did Democrats lose a stronger Democratic seat, they lost the voice of a non-Northern Virginia Democrat to demonstrate the regional diversity of our party. The difficulties in recruiting downstate Democrats for the House of Delegates spreads to higher offices. Wagner and McWaters could be vulnerable in Virginia Beach, but the Republican gerrymandering prevents local up and coming Democrats from getting a foothold. The number of Obama-won delegate seats dropped from 50 to 47. While many seats in Northern Virginia remained competitive, downstate saw larger changes. Virginia Beach in particular was hit hard, denying Democrats the chance of having a stronger farm team for running for higher office in the State Senate, Congress, or statewide. The 58th and 59th, two districts in Central Virginia that include portions of Albemarle, were made safely Republican. As a result, Republicans have prevented a local politician from developing a strong reputation and posing a risk to Robert Hurt in the 5th District. Democrats saw the pool of competitive seats shrink from 59 to 52 after redistricting. The net five-seat reduction in safe Democratic seats is a primary reason that the House Democrats have hit rock bottom. But fewer competitive seats downstate also reduces the farm team of good candidates for other elected offices, painting our party into a corner in Northern Virginia. Overall nonpartisan redistricting would produce small, marginal improvements over Republican gerrymandering for Democrats. The biggest impact would be a few more safe Democratic seats, and a larger playing field of potentially competitive seats, especially outside of Northern Virginia.

With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Tuesday was the best day for Democrats politically since Barack Obama won reelection in 2012. Remember, conservatives scored significant victories in the November 2014, 2015 and 2016 elections. Democrats desperately needed some wins after they went all-in on a House special election in Georgia this spring and lost. Last night, they got them. Voters came out in droves. They braved the rain and the cold to send a message to President Trump. The results across the country represent nothing less than a stinging repudiation of Trump on the first anniversary of his election. -- Democrat Ralph Northam was elected governor of Virginia Tuesday by an unexpectedly large margin of nine percentage points. He won more votes than any previous candidate for Virginia governor. Four in 10 Virginia voters yesterday approved of the job that the president is doing, according to preliminary exit polls. Gillespie received over 9 in 10 votes from Trump approvers, but among the larger group of Trump disapprovers, Northam had nearly as large an advantage: 87 percent. Half as many (17 percent) sought to express support for the president, while 47 percent said Trump was not a factor in their choice. -- Women made the difference. Married women voted for Northam by 10 points according to preliminary exit polls, 54 percent to 44 percent. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump eked out a one-point lead with this group, 48 percent to 47 percent. Married women consisted of 30 percent of Virginia voters this year, about the same share as in 2016 and 2014. -- Rep. Scott Taylor, a Republican who represents Virginia Beach, said both Democrats and Republicans registered their disenchantment with Trump. Democrats came out en masse in protest. This was their first chance to mobilize the base. The lesson here is that Republicans have to get their act together. Despite active opposition from the Republican governor and an influx of outside money, the measure passed by a nearly 20-point margin. This will mean health-care coverage for an estimated 70,000 low-income residents. By winning a special election, Democrats took control of the Senate in Washington State. This gives the party full control of all three states on the West Coast: a blue wall of sorts. Joyce Craig is the first Democrat elected mayor there in 14 years. In North Carolina, the Republican mayor of Fayetteville lost his bid for a third term. Maine approving Medicaid expansion by such a margin should be a warning sign for Republicans to tread very carefully when it comes to their continuing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In Virginia, the network exit poll asked respondents which one of five issues mattered most in deciding their vote for governor: 39 percent said health care, far more than any other issue. And health-care focused voters favored Northam by a giant 77 percent to 23 percent margin in preliminary exit polls. Gillespie won handily among those who named taxes and immigration as their top issue. The candidates split among those who picked gun policy. -- To understand the true magnitude of the Democratic victory, look to the down-ballot races in Virginia. Democrats, many of them unknown first-time candidates, are poised to pick up at least 14 seats in the House of Delegates. Four other races were so close that they qualify for a recount, and results will determine control of the chamber. Democrats needed to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the House of Delegates. No one thought going into last night that it was seriously in play. One ominous sign for congressional Republicans: Northam won the district held by Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) in the D.C. suburbs by 13 points. The results are a big validation for outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who is term-limited and could use the gains as a rationale to run for president in 2020. He was surprised by the scale of the pick-ups. Ten of their replacements will be women. Supporters of Ralph Northam cheer as he speaks at his victory rally at George Mason University in Fairfax. Democrats composed 41 percent of the electorate, up four points from 2013 and one point from last year. Republicans were 31 percent of the electorate, a record low in two decades of exit polls. -- Turnout was the highest in 20 years for a gubernatorial race, five percentage points and 10 percentage points higher than the last two. Consider this amazing statistic: In 2014, Gillespie won Loudoun County (DC exurbs) by 456 votes. -- Nonwhite voters turned out at presidential election rates in Virginia, surprising the experts who were trying to model the election on both sides. African Americans accounted for 21 percent of voters, according to the exits, the same as in 2016. When McAuliffe won four years ago, nonwhite voters accounted for 28 percent of the electorate. On Tuesday, they made up 33 percent of those who voted. That 5 percent is pivotal because black voters favored Northam by a 73-point margin and Hispanics favored Northam by 33 points. Seattle Mayor-elect Jenny Durkan, right, joins supporters waving signs on Tuesday. (The Advocate) St. Paul, Minn., elected its first black mayor.

Bill de Blasio easily won a second term as mayor of New York City. (Dave Weigel) Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was reelected by a 30-point margin. In the short term, the defeat is likely to broaden a deepening divide between traditional Republicans, who have lost influence among grass-roots GOP voters, and the new populist conservatives who have embraced the polarizing approach of the president. In the aftermath of defeat, some Republicans called for staying the course. HOW THE RETURNS PLAYED ON SOCIAL MEDIA: -- Yes, Virginia went for Clinton last year. Yes, the demographics are changing. But it was anything but inevitable that Northam would win. The bigger explanation is a backlash to Trump and Trumpism, pure and simple. Democrats were gleeful and expressed hope that Republicans elsewhere will be less inclined to replicate the tactics in 2018. From a former senior adviser to Barack Obama: At least Ed Gillespie still has his dignity. Oh wait, never mind. From the chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), a possible 2020 challenger to Trump: Another thing GOP candidates: to thine own self be true.

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Republicans are shrugging off what looks to be an inevitable defeat in New Jersey and are refocusing their eyes to the battleground of Virginia. For once, Newt speaks the truth. People here are angry, and in the months since the election this anger has transformed into something very frightening to Republicans: grassroots organizing. Newly energized Virginians are attending protests, demanding to speak to their congressman, and driving hours across sprawling gerrymandered districts to attend town halls. This is political manipulation at its worst. Hillary Clinton won Virginia by a comfortable 5 points, and while much of the country is distracted by demographic upsets in the Rust Belt, Virginia leads a trend line along the coastal south that has Republicans scrambling. To maintain power, it is imperative they retain control until the redistricting scheduled for 2021. Because without gerrymandered control, Republicans will start losing. So they are already doubling down on every possible dirty trick from voter suppression to fear mongering. While Republicans need to drum up financial support, they also know being open about their larger plan risks further mobilizing Democratic voters. The Republicans have a long-range strategy for these state legislatures. The only thing holding them back is the certainty of veto from the current Democratic governor, a situation they are hoping to remedy this November. Of course the national party is only interested in doing this in a few choice locations like Virginia. A bipartisan system would contribute to fair representation, but since the state leans Democratic, it would also likely result in Virginia adding a couple more Democrats to the House of Representatives, moving the needle in Congress. If recent months have taught us nothing else, it should be this: if Democrats had kept control of even one branch of Congress, Donald Trump would be nowhere near as dangerous. All the shenanigans in D.C. are acting as a catalyst, exploding long simmering frustrations about the complacent incumbents choosing their voters through gerrymandering. The situation is so extreme that despite the majority of Virginians voting for a Democratic presidential ticket last year, Virginia still sent 7 Republicans and only 4 Democrats to the House of Representatives. The answer is twofold: gerrymandering combined with low turn-out off-year elections. Like the one about to happen in 2017. This November, all 100 seats of the Virginia House of Delegates are up for election, and Democrats will field candidates in at least 45 red-leaning districts, including 17 that Hillary Clinton carried last November. At a recent community gathering showcasing new candidates, I noticed an interesting trend. These newly minted politicians made a point of mentioning how long it has been since their Republican incumbent has seen a challenger. That is how safe and cozy these Republican incumbents have become. Election after election, they have been the only name on the ballot. But now people are standing up and stepping forward: members of the community willing to run for office; citizens who recognize the system is unfairly stacked against them, but will try anyway. To do something. To dedicate the next 8 months of their lives to knocking on doors, speaking at local meetings and town halls, pounding the pavement and handing out yard signs and fliers in the sweltering Virginia summer. And they need help. Because the district lines have been drawn against them. Because challenging an incumbent is hard even in a fair fight. Because local elections get little press, and elections in off years suffer from low turnout. And because most of these people are just regular folks who are committing to this grind while still going to work and taking care of the kids. Do not wait for 2018. This November Virginia has an opportunity to deal the first major electoral blow to the Party of Trump. Gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics cannot keep them in power forever. The voices of the majority are rising. The Resistance begins in Richmond. A list of the candidates for the the Virginia House of Delegates can be found here.

Earlier this year, Dean announced a multi-year campaign, Purple to Blue, which will focus on electing Democrats to state legislatures and building grassroots support networks for the candidates. Purple to Blue starts this year in Virginia. In 2014 the campaign will focus on legislative candidates in Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The efforts will return to Virginia in 2015, when voters will elect both delegates and state senators. Freeda Cathcart is the Democratic candidate running against Chris Head (R-17). Head supported both the TRAP regulation of abortion clinics intended to drive them out of business and the mandatory ultrasound law passed in Virginia. Cathcart was instrumental in the fight to get approval for midwives to practice in the Commonwealth, as well as working with Sen. John Edwards on the bill to make practitioners notify women with dense breast tissue of options to ordinary mammograms which often miss cancer in those women. She is also the founder of Mothers United against Uranium Mining and has worked with a bi-partisan coalition to keep the ban on uranium mining in Virginia."}

Senate races expected to have wide-ranging impact Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), seen at the South Carolina Democratic Party state convention on Saturday, is going after national donors to focus on upcoming state Senate races. All 40 Senate seats are up for election in November, along with all 100 in the House of Delegates. These critical races get underway with Democrats at a disadvantage: Republicans already have control of the Senate by a slim margin of 21 seats to 19. Democrats have to hold on to every one of their seats and pick up another just to reach a tie. Democrats would hold sway over a 20-20 Senate because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Holding their current seats is not a given. Democrats thought they had a shot against Sen. Bryce E. Reeves (R-Spotsylvania), a freshman who won by a slim margin four years ago. But his Democratic challenger, Traci Dippert, unexpectedly quit the race this month after struggling to raise funds, leaving the party scrambling for a replacement. Two open seats are thought to be in play, to replace retiring Sens. Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William) and John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan). In those districts, Democrats are embroiled in tough primary battles while Republicans have their candidates in place. The GOP has challenges of its own, starting with demographic shifts that could make it hard to retain the seat that Watkins held onto by dint of his moderate image and personal popularity. Democrats recruited Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, to take on Black, a vocal opponent of abortion. So far, McAuliffe has not raised significantly more than his predecessor, Robert F. McDonnell (R), had by the same point in his governorship. But that is expected to change. But he was optimistic that the GOP can overcome that. Leaders in both parties said their chances were bolstered by high-quality candidates. Democrats, for instance, have been singing the praises of McCollum, a Cox Communications executive, minister and former Army Ranger who grew up in public housing in Richmond. Parrish is the son of the late Harry J. Parrish, a long-serving mayor and state delegate. Among the seats Democrats hope to pick up is the Richmond-area territory that Watkins is giving up. Democrats have won every statewide race there since 2012. Republicans say they can beat that trend with Glen Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member and lawyer with three adopted children. Before Democrats can take him on, they have to contend with a three-way primary among environmental activist Emily Francis, Chesterfield County Supervisor Daniel Gecker and former delegate Alexander McMurtrie. The establishment is firmly behind Gecker, a lawyer, but some liberals have grumbled because he once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) said he was confident that his party would prevail. Republicans are trying to knock off Edwards, a member of the Senate since 1996, with Nancy Dye, a retired surgeon, businesswoman and civic leader. Caldwell supporters were circulating petitions last week to put him on the ballot, according to two people familiar with those efforts. Comments The story must be told.

Terry McAuliffe said recently that electing Democrats to the state Senate will help him advance his agenda on items such as Medicaid expansion, gun control and education spending even with a Republican-controlled House. Polls closed at 7 p.m. The GOP had a narrow 21-19 advantage heading into Election Day, and a net gain of one seat for the Democrats would give them effective control of the chamber with the tie-breaking vote of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. Mr. McPike also had outspent Mr. Parrish by about 2-to-1 on TV ads through Nov. 2, according to a compilation by the Center for Public Integrity. The political action committee of Mr. McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, also spent heavily on the race, as well as others in the state. In another tight race, Republican Glen Sturtevant was battling Democrat Dan Gecker in the Richmond-area 10th Senate District to replace retiring GOP Sen. John C. Watkins in a contest Democrats had eyed as a prime pick-up opportunity. That race included Independent Marleen Durfee and Libertarian Carl Loser. Mr. McAuliffe had said that a net pick-up of one Senate seat would brighten the prospects for items on his agenda like Medicaid expansion, gun control and education spending. But even with the state Senate hanging in the balance, Mr. McAuliffe would still be limited by a solidly Republican House of Delegates, which was on track to easily remain in GOP hands.

That race is the subject of a pending lawsuit filed in federal court. Republicans currently hold onto their majority in the Virginia House by a 51-49 margin. The GOP boasted a 66-to-34 majority going into the Nov. 7 elections. Democrats would take control for the first time since 2000 if they prevail in two of the three contested races.

Recounts are overseen by a panel including the chief judge of the local circuit court and two judges appointed by the chief justice of the Virginia Supreme Court.

Republican Ed Gillespie gives remarks at his election night party in Springfield, Va. All of it has left some to wonder whether Warner would have won bigger if he had eschewed the middle and embraced the left, and whether the winning path for moderates that Warner forged during his own bid for governor 13 years ago is becoming extinct. Warner declared victory over Gillespie late Tuesday, but the contest was so close that Gillespie declined to concede. Gillespie may ask for a recount once the votes are certified by state election officials, a process that election officials expect to complete Nov. 24. Volunteers from both parties began a canvass of results that is expected to last until Friday afternoon. By the end of Wednesday, Warner had gained about 500 votes after a few errors were found in four precincts, officials said. Instead, aside from a few debate references, Warner helped Gillespie stay away from such divisive issues as abortion and same-sex marriage. The counties in that region voted for Gillespie, sometimes by more than 30 points over Warner. Warner has given no indication that he plans to change course in the newly Republican-controlled Senate, either. If anything, he expects to have more room to reach bipartisan accord now. He has made no secret of his disdain for the culture of gridlock on Capitol Hill. could make life in the Senate more rewarding, Warner shared a recent conversation with Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).

The two trends will collide Tuesday in a low-turnout election following an ugly campaign in which the candidates have repeatedly accused each other of lying about their records. Right now, the race has come down to turnout models. That series has shown a consistent five-point gap between Conway and Bevin for several weeks, prompting the last-minute intervention by the GOP. In Virginia, voters will elect both chambers of their legislature. Currently, the GOP has a supermajority in the House and a narrow majority in the Senate, which they have used to keep Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in check. But the bigger prize is the White House. Virginia Republicans caught a break this election season with the continuing resolution in Congress, which forestalled a potentially damaging government shutdown. That CR may not have been popular in other parts of the Republican world, but the avoidance of a shutdown was good news for the GOP in northern Virginia, where many federal workers and contractors live. It removed a headache for the state party, at the very least, allowing them to focus on the other issues in the election. In fact, this might be even more interesting than Kentucky, especially as a harbinger for 2016. Ed Gillespie did a surprisingly good job in his GOTV efforts last year, and came within a whisker of a shocking upset of Mark Warner in the US Senate race. In my research for Going Red (which will be published by Crown Forum next spring), it became clear that the state GOP learned a lot of lessons from Gillespie and from the failure of the campaigns in 2012 and 2013, the latter of which saw Ken Cuccinelli lose to McAuliffe. Update: So much for the polling in Kentucky. Matt Bevin appears to have won big: BREAKING: Matt Bevin elected governor of Kentucky, only the 2nd Republican governor in 4 decades.

Partly cloudy skies after midnight. Low 69F. Winds light and variable. Well, not all voters. In the days leading up to Election Day, both parties and their out-of-state surrogates have spent record amounts in advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. McPike, 40, a volunteer firefighter from Dale City who is director of general services for the city of Alexandria, is fighting to hold onto the seat occupied since 1976 by Sen. Charles J. Colgan, D-Prince William, who is retiring. The race is one of two in swing districts considered the closest and most crucial to controlling the chamber. The other close race is in the 10th District, where Gecker, a businessman and member of the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, is battling with Republican Glen H. Sturtevant, a lawyer and Richmond School Board member, to succeed retiring Sen. John Watkins, R-Powhatan. The contest also features independent Marleen K. Durfee and Libertarian Carl R. Loser. Both parties also are taking on incumbents in races that are considered longer shots. Republicans are challenging Democrats in Roanoke, where retired surgeon Nancy Dye is taking on Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke, in the 21st District seat he has held since 1996. Republican Richard Ottinger is making a play for the 6th District seat held by Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr., D-Accomack. In January 2014, Lewis won a special election to succeed Northam by 11 votes. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to unseat GOP incumbents in Virginia Beach and Loudoun. In District 13, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician, is challenging Sen. Richard H. Black, R-Loudoun, a lawyer and former state delegate who has held the seat since 2012. In District 7, Gary McCollum, a former Cox Communications executive, is trying to unseat Sen. Frank W. Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, the former owner of a ship repair company who has held the seat since 2001. McAuliffe, along with U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, a former Virginia governor, is scheduled to make stops today on behalf of Edwards, McCabe, McPike, Lewis, McCollum and Gecker. Only 38 of the 100 House of Delegates seats have more than one candidate, and nine of those contests have only independent or third-party challengers to a Democrat or Republican. All but 11 incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Only 22 of 40 Virginia Senate races have more than one candidate, with two of the 22 featuring only an independent or third-party challenge to a sitting incumbent. All but seven incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Kidd said turnout in elections in which General Assembly contests lead the ballot has steadily declined over the past three decades, driven by gerrymandered districts that provide little or no competition to incumbents. Turnout dipped from 51 percent in 1983 to 29 percent in 2011. A recent Wason Center survey predicts turnout of between 23 and 29 percent on Tuesday. He said Republicans have the advantage going into this off-year cycle because they hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature. Given the scarcity of competition, money has poured into the few races where both parties are running robust campaigns. In addition to the Parrish-McPike race, two other Senate contests are on pace to break money records. Everytown is backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose name has been frequently invoked by the Republicans who Everytown is going up against. Kidd was less sure about whether the avalanche of political advertising in the two most closely watched races, to succeed Watkins in the 10th and Colgan in the 29th, would change the outcome. In Chesterfield, Republican Amanda Chase, who defeated 21-year incumbent Stephen H. Martin, R-Chesterfield, in a June primary, is running in a GOP-tilted 11th District race against Democrat Wayne Powell. Dye is challenging Edwards, and McCabe is challenging Black in races that are competitive but expected to lean toward the incumbents. Regardless of the outcome Tuesday, major changes on major issues are unlikely to result. getRecommendations. audiences or keywords to work with."}

The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda. All 140 seats in the General Assembly were on the ballot. Democrats could have taken control by picking up just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). But Republicans held all of their seats. View Graphic See the full results for statewide and local races. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), meanwhile, held out hope that the results could change. He said he suspected irregularities in a Richmond-area race won by the GOP because Republican turnout was so heavy. As of late Tuesday night, Democrat Dan Gecker had not conceded to his opponent, Glen Sturtevant. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a record tax hike in 2004. But Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. McAuliffe faces a more conservative Senate Republican caucus and a House with a wide GOP majority. McAuliffe, once a record-smashing fundraiser for his close friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, had hoped a win would help sway purple Virginia in 2016. National donors and outside groups on the left and right seized on the state Senate races. Republicans and Democrats alike went into Tuesday predicting success. The party sent out a two-page memo to reporters laying out reasons why this might not be its year. It noted that Republicans tend to vote in off-year elections such as this one, that Democrats are playing in traditionally Republican districts and that money has flowed in from outside groups. Fatigue from a seventh year of the Obama White House hurts even more, Democrats said. McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, favors Medicaid expansion, gun control and abortion rights. Democrats conceded that unseating Black would be as difficult as their quest to oust incumbent Republican Frank W. Wagner in Virginia Beach. Wagner withstood a challenge from Democrat Gary McCollum. Wagner, the former owner of a ship repair company, seemed vulnerable after reports that he took gifts from special interests and sponsored legislation friendly to Dominion Virginia Power. But McCollum was stung by revelations that he misrepresented his military record. Nearby, Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack) successfully defended a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger was Republican Richard H. Ottinger. In southwest Virginia, Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) prevailed in a three-way race against Republican Nancy Dye and Democrat-turned-independent Don Caldwell. Along with gun control, highway tolls came to dominate races in Northern Virginia late in the campaign. Democratic candidates said they opposed it as well, but the GOP contended that they could not be trusted to buck a governor of their own party once in office. They used the attacks against Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) and Democratic state delegate candidates John Bell and Jennifer Boysko. Meanwhile in the House of Delegates, in preliminary returns, Republicans appeared to narrowly lose their veto-proof majority, but they still maintained a huge advantage over Democrats in the polarized chamber. House Democrats picked up two seats in districts formerly held by Republicans who did not seek reelection. Boysko defeated businessman Danny Vargas (R) for Del. Bell defeated Republican Chuong Nguyen for the seat held by David I. Ramadan (R-Loudoun). Late Tuesday, Murphy was embroiled in a tight race with Craig Parisot, the Republican she narrowly defeated in a special election last year. This time around, less than 200 votes separated the candidates, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Fairfax County officials said that they will recheck the totals for Murphy and Parisot on Wednesday to see whether a recount is warranted. Late Tuesday, Republican Mark Dudenhefer was leading Democrat Josh King to take back the seat he held for one term before losing it to Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William).

Democrats snared at least 15 seats in an upset that stunned members of both parties and arrived with national implications. Unofficial returns showed Democrats unseating at least a dozen Republicans and flipping three seats that had been occupied by GOP incumbents who did not seek reelection. Four other races were so close that they qualify for a recount, and the outcome will determine control of the chamber. The results marked the most sweeping shift in control of the legislature since Reconstruction. Republicans, who have controlled the chamber since 2000, went into Tuesday holding 66 of 100 seats. Democrats fielded the most candidates in recent memory, including a record number of women. Control of the chamber may not be determined for days as provisional ballots are counted in narrow races. Democrats need to hold one seat where they are narrowly leading to ensure a 50-50 split where power sharing would be necessary, and to pick up an additional seat in a race eligible for a recount to take full control of the chamber. The election signaled a major shift in the gender of a body long dominated by men: Of the 15 seats Democrats flipped, all were held by men and 11 were won by women. Several of those women made history. One became Virginia's first openly transgender person to win elective office, unseating an opponent of LGBT rights. Another became the first open lesbian elected to the House of Delegates, another the first Asian American woman and two, both from diverse Prince William County, are set to be the first Latinas elected to the General Assembly. Although House races are normally seen as the sleepy backwater to the gubernatorial contest, they generated a surge of interest this year from activists energized by President Trump's election and new groups that see the legislative contests as an opportunity to test strategies and technologies ahead of next year's elections. Strategists said the results suggest trouble for Republicans. The highest-spending House of Delegates race was in southwest Virginia, where former television news anchor Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015, challenged Republican incumbent Joseph Yost. Subba Kolla, who would have been the body's first Indian American lawmaker, lost to Del. John J. Bell in Loudoun County, and Heather Cordasco fell to Del. Michael P. Mullin in Hampton Roads. Democrats flipped the most seats in Northern Virginia as Northam posted a strong showing in the populous region. The biggest battleground for the House was Prince William, a Washington exurb where people of color constitute a majority of the population. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), a culture warrior who opposes LGBT rights. Elizabeth Guzman, who raised more money than any Democratic candidate except for Hurst, unseated Del. L. Scott Lingamfelter (R-Woodbridge). Republican Dels. Richard L. Anderson (Prince William) and Jackson H. Miller (Manassas) lost to their Democratic challengers, Hala Ayala and Lee Carter. Ayala and Guzman are Latina, and Carter is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In an open seat vacated by a retiring Republican, Democrat Jennifer Carroll Foy easily defeated Republican Michael Makee. In Fairfax County, Democrat Kathy Tran, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, beat Republican Lolita Mancheno-Smoak for an open seat vacated by retiring Del. David B. Albo (R), while Democrat Karrie Delaney handily defeated Del. James M. LeMunyon (R). Del. Timothy D. Hugo, the Republican caucus chairman, was narrowly trailing Democratic challenger Donte Tanner, and the results were within the margin for a state-funded recount. Hugo picked up 100 votes during a Fairfax County canvass on Wednesday morning. Greason's fellow Loudoun County lawmaker, Del. J. Randall Minchew, lost his seat to Democratic challenger Wendy Gooditis. In the Richmond suburbs, Dels. John M. O'Bannon III and G. Manoli Loupassi lost their seats to Debra Rodman and Dawn Adams, who is openly lesbian. Democrat Schuyler T. VanValkenburg won an open seat vacated by Republican Jimmie Massie III. In the Virginia Beach area, Del. Del. Glenn R. Davis Jr. narrowly pulled out a win for reelection. Republicans were barely leading in three contests that were in the margin for a recount, including in the race to succeed retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). Del. David Yancey (R-Newport News) led Shelly Simonds by only 12 votes. Even if Democrats fall short of taking control of the chamber this year, they see a potential for additional pickups next year, if a court challenge of legislative district maps forces special elections, and in 2019 when all 100 seats are on the ballot again. Republicans have a narrow 21-to-19 majority in the state Senate, where all seats are up in 2019. Control of the governor's mansion and legislature in Virginia has national implications. The General Assembly will draw congressional and state legislative district maps after the 2020 Census, and the governor has the power to veto those maps.

Fairfax, an Annandale attorney and former federal prosecutor, is the second African American to be elected statewide in Virginia, after L. Douglas Wilder, who served as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1986 to 1994. He beat state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Fauquier), who embraced President Trump throughout her campaign and staked out strongly conservative positions on guns, abortion rights and the economy.

Neither the lieutenant governor's race nor the attorney general's contest drew the white-hot attention of the Virginia gubernatorial battle this year, but both were intense, hard-fought affairs. The part-time lieutenant governor's job comes with two major positives: In case of a tie in the state Senate, the lieutenant governor can cast a ballot. Additionally, the No. 2 job positions a politician for a run for higher office. Virginia election results 2017: Live maps, analysis, complete updates View Graphic Fairfax, who surprised Democrats by coming within three percentage points of defeating Herring in the primary for attorney general in 2013, said he wants to get Virginians into middle-skill jobs, lower student interest rates and expand Medicaid, an effort that has been stopped over the past four years by the Republican majority in the General Assembly. He suffered an insult from his own party this fall when his name was omitted from about 1,000 pieces of Democratic campaign literature produced for the Laborers' International Union of North America, which did not endorse Fairfax because he was critical of two proposed natural gas pipelines that the union supports. Among other things, Vogel and Fairfax clashed over the issue of Confederate monuments. Vogel has hammered Fairfax for calling the statues divisive and harmful, a message she has underlined at appearances before white, rural voters in southwest Virginia. More than one-third of Vogel's money came from her father, William B. Holtzman, founder of Holtzman Oil. Far more expensive, and just as politically polarized, was the campaign for attorney general, with millions of dollars of donations poured into the candidates' coffers by each party's association of attorneys general. Money came from interest groups at both ends of the political spectrum. Early in his first term, Herring refused to defend Virginia's same-sex marriage ban and joined the side challenging that ban. In his assessment, he said, the law was unconstitutional and on the wrong side of history; Adams said Herring's decision was an indefensible abandonment of the office's responsibility to defend state law. Herring also touted his record on reducing the state's backlog of untested rape kits, cracking down on gangs and leading a Medicaid fraud unit. Adams said he entered the race because he thinks Herring has turned the top legal office in the state into a partisan political operation. A conservative who opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, Adams said he would not let his beliefs affect his legal decisions or advice. Adams twice represented clients in Supreme Court cases who objected to requirements that employers provide and pay for contraceptive insurance coverage for their employees. He and Herring differed on gun control, labor union rights, immigration and most hot-button topics.

When Sanders lost, Murillo switched to Donald Trump, the other guy he figured would step up for regular people. It was all very exciting, a show that just kept on going. For a while, he even felt hopeful. Now, Murillo knows Virginia is electing a new governor in three weeks, but he's paid little attention. Virginians speak of being exhausted by events. They say that they have only so much bandwidth and that President Trump takes up most of the space they allot to politics. They say they haven't heard much about the governor's race in the news, which seems devoted mainly to the president's doings and sayings. But far fewer Virginia voters are closely following the campaign than at similar stages in the past three gubernatorial elections, according to Washington Post polling. View Graphic Virginia general election guide Even those who might be assumed to be searching for a way to send a message about a president they consider inept or dangerous say they are paying little attention to the Virginia race. Cox, 35, usually follows campaigns for governor closely, taking weekend time to thoroughly research the candidates' views. Not this year. Virginia's unusual practice of picking a governor the year after presidential elections has historically led to low turnouts; in 2013, a year after 71 percent of Virginia voters cast ballots for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, only 43 percent came out to the polls to choose Democrat Terry McAuliffe as governor over Republican Ken Cuccinelli II. Former vice president Joe Biden and Ralph Northam in Reston, Va., on Oct. 14, and Vice President Pence and Ed Gillespie in Abingdon, Va., on Oct. 14. This year's highly polarized politics have led activists on both the pro- and anti-Trump sides to anticipate stronger than average engagement in the governor's race, if only as a proxy by which voters could express their views on the president. Both parties are eager to urge Virginians to see the governor's race through a national prism; Obama and former vice president Joe Biden are campaigning for Democrat Ralph Northam, and Vice President Pence appeared with Republican Ed Gillespie on Saturday, as Trump may yet do later in the month. Northam, the lieutenant governor, and Gillespie, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, are both more moderate in their politics than the most popular figures in their parties. Compared to the candidates both parties put up for governor four years ago, Northam and Gillespie seem like throwbacks to a quieter, gentler time. But in past governor's races, Republicans have proved themselves more likely than Democrats to vote in off-year elections. Voters in both primaries last spring chose milder, more moderate alternatives to more populist candidates, Democrat Tom Perriello and Republican Corey A. Stewart. And even some voters who have paid little attention to this year's campaign say they're in the mood for something a bit less volatile. Patrick Day, a 35-year-old teaching assistant at a Virginia Beach elementary school, said he got caught up in the frenzy of last year's election and voted for Trump mainly as a way of rejecting Clinton. Despite his eagerness to shift directions, Day hasn't paid much attention to the governor's race. It just never ends with our president. If he wouldn't talk or tweet, he'd be a lot better. Veterans of Democratic and Republican campaigns alike say they are seeing voters step back from the battlefield. Nationwide, the number of reporters covering state houses plummeted by 35 percent from 2003 to 2014, according to the Pew Research Center. The trend has continued since then, as has the shrinking of overall staffing and space for news in many papers. The result, some say, is a campaign that gets less coverage than many Virginia voters are accustomed to seeing. Jill Mulhall, a freelance editor who lives in Bristow in Prince William County, usually relies on local news outlets such as InsideNoVa.com and the Gainesville Times, as well as Facebook, to learn about the candidates.

Gov. Ralph Northam to unify the party as its anointed candidate, it also plunged Virginia into an intriguing story line that echoes the recent presidential contest. On the Republican side, the well-connected Ed Gillespie, a longtime strategist for national candidates and adviser to President George W. Bush, is trying hard to seem inevitable. And state Sen. Frank W. Wagner (R-Virginia Beach) is a dark-horse candidate who has strong support in the populous Hampton Roads region. Both parties will hold June primaries. The national parties are expected to pour money and attention into Virginia. And Republicans uneasy with the direction Trump has taken their party might look for solace with the steady Gillespie. Until now, most of the hand-wringing in Virginia has been on the Republican side, which looked to have a nasty internal fight on its hands between the mainstream and the Trump insurgency. Gillespie, who has led in fundraising and endorsements, must figure out how to run as a Republican in the Trump era. But also, potentially, threatening. Perriello, 42, grew up in Charlottesville and held the sprawling 5th Congressional District seat for one term before losing in the 2010 general election. He later served as a special envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa until stepping down in December. An early and prominent Obama ally during his time in Congress, Perriello blindsided state Democrats on Wednesday night with a round of phone calls notifying them that he was planning to run for governor. He said Thursday that he had been prohibited by the Hatch Act from pursuing a campaign while he was a federal employee. It was only in the past 10 days, he said, that he and his family decided to go for it and he began assembling a staff. At midday, Perriello spoke to a hastily assembled crowd of 80 or more in Charlottesville, pulled together mainly through social media. Perriello himself rejects any comparison to Sanders. That, of course, is another juicy story line in the race: Northam is the successor chosen by current Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a close confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton and wielder of their election money and machinery. Perriello is admired by Obama, who campaigned for him in the 2010 congressional race and assuaged his loss with a diplomatic posting. Those alliances raise the specter of the old Clinton-Obama rivalry that permeated national Democratic politics a decade ago. Clinton still has a lot of support among state Democratic leaders, who were proud of Virginia being the only Southern state to tilt her way in the election. And Northam is a standard-bearer who lacks any of the Clinton baggage. He is a Virginia Military Institute graduate, Gulf War veteran and pediatric neurologist who hunts, fishes and speaks with the folksy drawl of an Eastern Shore native. Supporters say his biography and collegial manner could play well across an increasingly polarized state, where Democrats have dominated Northern Virginia and other urban centers but have little following elsewhere. For now, though, Virginia Democrats are just beginning to absorb this unexpected spectacle. At the Charlottesville announcement, Jon Chasen, a 40-year-old financial adviser and member of the Albemarle County Democratic steering committee, said he was intrigued by the new development. Tom is young and a little different. But the first few months of the Trump administration will show how that translates into reality and what it means for politics. Comments The story must be told.

The attorney general has been asked for an official opinion about control of the Senate but has not yet issued one. The GOP says that with a Republican serving as lieutenant governor, who casts tiebreaking votes, it has control of the chamber, allowing the party to appoint a majority leader, run committees and determine which bills go to the Senate floor for a vote. Democrats contend that they are entitled to share power. Last month, a Richmond judge ruled against Sen. A.

Democrats hope investment in data and field operations pays off Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is helping his party get ready state Senate races this year and the 2016 presidential election. The Democrats hope that the investment will pay off not just this year but also in 2016, when political observers expect Virginia to be one of the most competitive states in the presidential race. The state party has 69 paid field staffers working on five competitive state Senate races, about 14 times as many as it did in 2011, the last time only state lawmakers were on the ballot. McAuliffe, a close ally of former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, has made no secret of his plans to help the Democratic front-runner win in Virginia. While he was all over the country and television as her campaign chairman in 2008, this cycle he is focused on building up an infrastructure for Clinton in Virginia. Officials from both parties agree that data collection in Virginia is particularly challenging. More than a quarter of a million people leave the state each election cycle and a quarter of a million new people move in. Democrats say they have records of party preference for about 65 percent of the electorate. To build out a model to predict the behavior of the rest, they have done deep surveys on 7,000 people, with over-sampling in competitive state Senate districts. They have a ranking for everyone in the state based on their likelihood to support Democrats and likelihood to vote. Even with this investment, winning the state Senate will be a challenge for Democrats. Republicans have a strong and better-funded candidate running in Prince William County, where Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D) is retiring. In Virginia Beach, where Democrats are hoping to unseat Sen. Frank W. Wagner (R), their candidate has wounded himself by misrepresenting his military record. In 2007, when George W. Bush was nearing his seventh year in office, Democrats made historic gains in Virginia in part because of a national trend away from the GOP. Republicans see a similar White House fatigue this year, which is a boon for their party and a disadvantage for Democrats. A poll released Friday by Christopher Newport University backs up that confidence; likely voters support Republican Senate candidates by a 13-point margin. And Democrats who have previously worked in Virginia said that while the state Senate effort sounds very solid, so were past campaigns in the state. Republicans said their approach to organizing is different: They run their field operations through individual Senate campaigns, although state party Chairman John Whitbeck has also hired a dozen staffers to work the Senate races. In addition, the RNC has its own staff in each key area. And like the Democrats, the party has been training staff and volunteers in the kind of community organizing that was a hallmark of the Obama campaigns. Democrats say that relying on such consumer data is out of date and that the custom predictive models their party is using in Virginia are the future. Comments The story must be told.

But Northam says he is not looking to vanquish the other side. After an ugly gubernatorial campaign ended in a surprising Democratic sweep that reverberated across the nation, voters don't want showboating, he said. The Virginia results were widely interpreted as a repudiation by voters of Donald Trump's first year in the White House. The Republican president proved so unpopular that a wave of Democrats swept into office; in the House of Delegates, a 66-34 Republican majority vanished. The GOP is hanging onto a 51-49 edge, with recounts underway in three close races. The outcome was a harbinger of the Democratic tide that upended the Senate race in Alabama last week and set the stage for elections nationwide next year. He blamed Gillespie for inflaming the rhetoric by focusing on the Latino street gang MS-13 and suggesting Northam wanted to restore voting rights to a pedophile. A moderate Democrat who was once courted to switch parties by the Republicans, Northam was never a natural standard-bearer for the progressive activists who helped power the Democratic elections this year. Some in the new wave of delegates coming to Richmond have been openly critical of the party's establishment. I'll try to lead that. We talk about the doctor being in, healing, and I'll try to bring people together and emphasize doing what's in the best interest of Virginia. That's echoed in his promise not to try to engineer a Democratic advantage in the legislature. Other governors with a closely divided House or Senate have dangled well-paying Cabinet jobs to lure a lawmaker from the opposite party to leave the Assembly and tilt the balance of power. It has been widely assumed that Northam is considering such a move, with Republicans holding a 21-19 edge in the state Senate and incoming Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, a Democrat, in a position to break tie votes. But Northam ruled that out. Similarly, Northam said he has no plans to try to force Republicans to accept a broad expansion of Medicaid. Instead, he has begun talks with lawmakers in both parties about overhauling the state's Medicaid system to expand access to health care while better defining eligibility to control costs. Outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) tried every year to push the legislature to accept millions in federal money to expand the health program to hundreds of thousands of low-income Virginians. Northam campaigned heavily on the promise of getting more Virginians access to health care. He said Friday that he remains committed to that pledge, but that he must be careful about obligating the state to escalating costs. Under the program, the federal government pays the lion's share in the early years but the state contribution gradually increases. He said he is consulting with legislators on both sides of the aisle to draw up the plans, as well as with retired state senator John Watkins, a Republican who worked on an earlier effort to create a state marketplace for private health insurance plans. The General Assembly will convene Jan. 10. He conceded that he can't match McAuliffe's salesmanship and manic dealmaking, and said the emphasis may shift from recruiting new employers to improving the climate for existing businesses. In that climate, Virginia could be a test case for whether political unity is still a viable route. Northam said national party figures have told him the Virginia results lifted up demoralized Democrats. His campaign staff has gotten queries from people looking to strategize in some of the 36 gubernatorial races or various House and Senate races set for around the country next year, he said. But asked if he had heard anything from the recent Doug Jones campaign, Northam drew a blank. Northam has yet to take any time off since the election and, aside from speaking engagements, has been swamped with interviewing job candidates for the Cabinet or state agencies. In his transition office near the Capitol, he constantly hears the roar and beeping of crews demolishing the old General Assembly office building next door. Symbolic or not, that demolition fits with what Northam says is a drive to push ideas of openness into state government. He'd like new state offices to be built with open floor plans, and hopes to have the governor's office outfitted with glass. He'd like more parking for visitors to the Capitol. A classic-car buff who restored a 1953 Oldsmobile with his brother and tinkers on a 1971 Corvette, Northam lit up when he said he'd like to invite car clubs to hold shows around the Executive Mansion and Capitol. Provided, he added, he can get permission from Susan Clarke Schaar, the longtime clerk of the Senate who keeps a tight rein on decorum. Northam's own future ambition is unclear. He hesitated to run for lieutenant governor four years ago but McAuliffe persuaded him. At least one Democratic official said recently that Northam has said he has no desire to run for anything after being governor. But on Friday, he dodged that question.

The decision means that Republicans control 51 seats in the House of Delegates while Democrats control 49. The action shuts down one potential route, but it does not end Democrats' hopes to win control of the chamber. In that race, Republican Robert Thomas leads Democrat Joshua Cole by 82 votes in the contest to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). Alcorn also said the board does not have the power to order any of the available remedies, such as a new election, which a judge could do. The losing candidate also could file a contest with the House, which could require a new election or pick a winner itself through a floor vote. In the 40th District, Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) has a 106-vote lead over Democrat Donte Tanner, while in the 94th District, Del. David E. Yancey (R-Newport News) is up just 10 votes over Democrat Shelly Simonds. Monday's decision came three weeks after Election Day, and a week after the board had certified election results in 98 other House seats. The board initially held off on the two Fredericksburg-area House seats amid revelations that some voters in the 28th and 88th districts had been erroneously assigned to the wrong race. The assignment errors affect both races, but the focus has been on the 28th because the margin of victory was just 82 votes. It is one of three tight GOP wins statewide that are likely headed for recounts. Democrats would need one more victory to force a power-sharing deal with Republicans and two more to take the reins of the chamber for the first time since 2000. The board's decision was a disappointment to Democrats and their allies, who since Nov. 7 have filed three lawsuits asserting that 28th District voters had been disenfranchised in various ways. Two of the cases were dismissed. In the third case, a federal judge rejected Democrats' request for a temporary restraining order to block the state board from certifying the 28th District election. But he did not dismiss the case, leaving Democrats the option of asking the judge for a new election. House Republicans had threatened to file a lawsuit of their own if the board did not certify the results by Monday. Partisan tensions appeared to be running high at the start of Monday's meeting, when Alcorn made a motion to retreat into executive session so members could confer with lawyers. Republican Clara Belle Wheeler abstained from voting on that motion. But she came out of the closed-door meeting with a smile and soon voted, along with Alcorn and Singleton McAllister, to certify the results. But if his election had remained uncertified, Mark Cole would not have been seated when the legislature convenes in January. That would have evenly split the chamber, 49 seats controlled by Republicans and 49 controlled by Democrats. Republicans boasted a 66-to-34 majority going into the Nov. 7 elections. After further investigation, he said the state had discovered a total of 384 misassigned voters, including some in the neighboring 2nd House District.

After Tuesday's pivotal legislative elections in Virginia, he might no longer have to just wonder. Outside groups are pouring into these suburban neighborhoods as they try and tip the balance in the Virginia state senate, a body that can flip to Democratic control with just one seat turning from red to blue. But the bigger prize is the White House. The answers could determine what kind of message Hillary Clinton emphasizes, or how much time and effort a Republican candidate spends trying to win votes in the more liberal Washington suburbs. Academics have long pined for candidates to apply the scientific method to their races, but few candidates are eager to sacrifice a possible win in order to prove intellectual points about modern campaigning. What has changed the game is the presence of outside advocacy groups with the funding and patience to think 10 years down the road -- and aren't tied to any particular candidate or party. These groups don't need to explain to a ballroom of supporters why they lost --- they can experiment, take whatever lessons they learn, good or bad, and get back to work next time. Then during the weeks after Election Day, AFP brass will check their data set and judge whether the treatment effect was large enough to be worth producing, printing and placing the hangers in the first place, as it promotes an agenda of expanding school choice, rolling back EPA regulations and fighting the expansion of Medicaid. Testing gun control messages These tests are unfolding in an unusual campaign season that those in Virginia politics describe as suddenly dominated not by groups like AFP, but by one man: Bloomberg, whose gun safety super PAC, Everytown for Gun Safety, has flooded Virginia with advertisements that conservatives have not been able to match. But Democrats nationally have been reluctant to run on gun platforms in presidential years, especially in swing-states like Ohio or here in Virginia, where gun ownership is high and the NRA is headquartered. In turn, Republicans like Hal Parrish, the Manassas mayor and state senate candidate in district 29, are looking to turn the tables on the New York-based group by casting them as outsiders in their own spots. The other leading gun-control super PAC, former congresswoman Gabby Giffords' Americans for Responsible Solutions, is less interested than Everytown in proving a point in the South than it is in testing bolder moves to come. Meanwhile, women's organizations like Emily's List are trying to fine-tune their demographic targeting to see which women can be mobilized on their issue. Another liberal group, New Virginia Majority, has two main experiments embedded into its get-out-the-vote program: some new English speakers have been sent mail in their first language, while others are being asked to read it in their second. That's the thinking of groups that plan to live another day even if McAuliffe is unable to flip the chamber, a task that he has devoted tremendous political muscle toward accomplishing. Gun-control groups think that he might be able to push through firearm legislation if the Senate turns Democratic; Republicans have trained their eyes on delivering the boastful former Democratic National Committee chair a stinging defeat a year before McAuliffe is expected to try and engineer a Clinton victory in November 2016. And for data-driven groups like AFP, it's a chance to learn exactly how to win it. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. .d8888b."}

In both races, gun safety was either the winning factor or helped tighten a race in a previously non-competitive GOP-held district. First, polling in and outside of Virginia shows more than 85 percent of Americans support common-sense firearms-violence prevention rules such as universal background checks or keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals. That spread is the new price to be paid for sticking by the gun lobby and being out of step with Virginia voters. In Senate District 10, Republicans kept an open seat they held for 17 years. Four years ago, John Watkins won by 12 percent, 4,300 votes. While blaming one issue for winning or losing elections is an interesting political parlor game, it is a vast oversimplification for a process that divines the intentions of more than 30,000 people. The focus on gun safety actually made District 10 a tighter, tougher fight for the Republicans than it should have been, closing the gap to a spread much closer than the prognosticators were expecting. The rest of Virginia is not far behind. The D.C. sniper, Virginia Tech and the on-air assassination of Alison Parker and Adam Ward have brought firearm violence to every corner of Virginia. This is, in part, because a lot of money was spent but also because thousands of Virginians were motivated to vote for candidates willing to stand up to the gun lobby. Guns are driving people to the polls, but in a twist on conventional wisdom, the voters heading to the polls are now voting for the candidates looking for ways to reduce gun violence.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Bill Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Both candidates emphasize kitchen-table issues such as economic development and education. But sharp ideological differences were on display last week as they appeared at a candidate forum. Sturtevant emphasized the need to reduce tax and regulatory burdens on businesses. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. Sometimes those are unanimous. Sometimes it's been a big majority in favor of one candidate or the other. That's just some context to today's Blue Virginia endorsement of Mark Herring, which was strong, unanimous, and completely without division or contention of any kind. Bottom line: on this one, there wasn't even any back and forth, as there often is, but a crystal clear choice: Mark Herring for Attorney General of Virginia. We will explain our decision in a minute, but first a note about the LG race. In discussions among the Blue Virginia front pagers, we found majority support for Aneesh Chopra, but we also found one person not comfortable making an endorsement in that race, and a couple (e.g., Teddy Goodson) supporting Ralph Northam. Given that, we've decided not to make a Blue Virginia group endorsement in the LG race. Now, back to our unanimous endorsement of Mark Herring. First off, we refer you to the Blue Virginia interview with Herring, as well as to Lowell's endorsement of Herring back in January. The interview discusses Herring's background and experience, his reasons for running, his vision for the AG's office, as well as his positions on a number of issues (e.g., pro-choice, pro-LGBT equality, pro-environment, pro-science, pro-consumer protection). For its part, the endorsement lays out the positive argument for Herring in detail, and we recommend that you read it. Also, see below for why we believe every Virginia Democrat and progressive should enthusiastically, and proudly, cast their vote for Mark Herring on Tuesday. The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) circulated this flier in 1993. I was in medical school at the time and I was the President of our AMSA chapter at my medical school. AMSA advocated for better gun control laws. It is obvious that physicians should stand up for gun control due to the high number of preventable deaths they cause. It is good public health policy to favor laws that make it tougher to obtain guns. In the countries listed above, it is difficult to get guns. Thus the reason for the low number of gun related deaths. Now I understand the importance of the second amendment. As a society we regulate the kinds of arms people are allowed to have. I believe that buying weapons should be heavily regulated. Virginia passed a law that attempted to reduce gun trafficking (one gun a month safeguard). This law had an affect on reducing illegal gun trafficking. (Something that everyone should be against regardless of you party affiliation). This was concluded in a report done in 1996 by the Virginia State Crime Commission. Recently, the Virginia General Assembly repealed this law. Two Democratic Senators were responsible for passing this repeal. Senators Creigh Deeds (Bath) and John Edwards (Roanoke) were the Democrats resposible for pushing this bill through. The governor signed it into law yesterday. This law would not have passed without their support. I have spent the better part of my life fighting for our democratic values. I find their vote and Senator Deeds' explanation offensive. It makes no sense to repeal this bill. Their vote should force us to examine their records. Normally I refrain from calling folks out by name. But the recent high school shooting in Ohio is another reminder of why gun laws need massive reform. In a democracy we have to make these changes in steps. We never get what we want the first time around. Gun proponents will say that this law is a first step in further restricting gun ownership. Every American should oppose illegal and irresponsible gun ownership. This law had done this. Senator Deeds' explanation for why he voted for repealing this bill is posted on the official website for the NRA chapter in Virginia. I would say they wrote it for him but their stuff is usually better written than the nonsense posted here. So I must assume he wrote this and he believes this dribble. Thanks to everyone who contributed. UPDATE by Lowell: Note that since this diary was posted, there have been a number of significant updates, per a long conversation with DPVA Executive Director Dave Mills. If possible put them in a set that looks like a waiting room, pharmacy, or hospital. That commercial came to mind during the recently concluded JJ Dinner weekend in Richmond. For those of us who attend JJ Dinners every year, this one offered a striking contrast to four years ago, near the height of the Democratic presidential primary contest between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, when well over 4,000 excited and energized Democrats gathered in Richmond for that year's JJ. Even conceding the unique competitive circumstances of 2008, a well-organized and promoted 2012 JJ Dinner in a presidential election year, when polls increasingly are showing Democratic enthusiasm and President Obama's popularity rising, and when there's a hotly-contested race for U.S. Senate between the highly popular Tim Kaine and the highly unpopular George Allen, should have generated at least 2,000 guests. Blue Virginia - December 23, 2010 0 The following is a guest post from our friend, and former RK front pager, Dan. Not to defend Haley Barbour, but you have to give a guy a break. Like most conservatives, he was imagining a wonderful period in history that never happened. I.E. a time during the civil rights era when a bunch of white southerners banded together to fight the evil Klu Klux Klan and fight for justice for all people. It didn't happen that way, true, but at least Barbour fantasizes that it did. It is not like he is bemoaning the civil rights movement or declaring it illegal. Only Rand Paul would do that. Just look at the guy. He makes Larry the Cable Guy look like the King of England. He has about as much chance of being President as Michelle Bachmann on a bad hair day. That brings me to racial issues in general. The conversation in the media on these issues is about as enlightening as a profile on Paris Hilton. It's like they want to see a fight break out. Cooch Tries to Turn VA Into AZ on Immigration Virginia Politics Blue Virginia - August 2, 2010 4 Oh wonderful. Law enforcement officials in Virginia can inquire into immigration status of those they stop or arrest--just as they can under a controversial new immigration law in Arizona--Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has ruled in an official legal opinion. Written in response to a request for legal advice from Del. Bob Marshall (R-Prince William), Cuccinelli ruled that police officers and other legal authorities can look into the immigration status of anyone stopped or arrested. Which makes this latest action so out of character, and so confusing. If it's an activist conservative Bush-appointed judge, it's not hard at all. A federal judge Monday morning refused to dismiss a Virginia lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the federal health-care law, handing the law's foes their first victory in a courtroom battle likely to last years. U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson rejected arguments from Obama administration lawyers that Virginia has no standing to sue over the law and no chance of ultimately prevailing in its constitutional claim. UPDATE: State Senator and Attorney Chap Petersen weighs in: My take on this whole episode is that the purchasing mandate (as I understand) does not take effect until 2014. There will be two elections for Congress BEFORE that time, and any future Congress has the ability to amend or even repeal the purchase mandate.

Terry McAuliffe. It is a big defeat for McAuliffe, a close ally for Hillary Clinton, and a big defeat for New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who donated heavily to Democrats in the hope of winning the Virginia electoral fights on a promise of more gun-control. Republicans beat back two serious challengers Tuesday, holding onto seats in the suburbs of Richmond and the Hampton Roads area. In another hotly contested race, Republican Hal Parrish holds a lead over Democrat Jerry McPike. If Parrish holds onto his lead, it would represent a Republican gain, as the two are battling to replace a retiring Democrat. McAuliffe, with considerable help from Bloomberg, bet his political capital on Democrats winning the upper Chamber. But he seems to have fallen far short. Republicans currently hold a 2-seat majority in the state Senate. Republicans have an overwhelming majority in the state House. Bloomberg was hoping to capitalize on the tragic shooting of two Virginia TV reporters by a disgruntled newsman earlier this Summer. He pumped millions into the race for two critical state Senate seats. As a result, both Democrats were able to dramatically outspend their Republican rivals. Bloomberg and his SuperPAC, Everytown for Gun Safety, hoped to show that Democrats could win on the issue of gun control. Also, Gov. McAuliffe had made enacting new restrictions on gun ownership a centerpiece of his campaigning for Democrats around the state. McAuliffe also campaigned aggressively for expanding Medicaid through ObamaCare and implementing universal preschool. Barred from running for reelection, McAuliffe will now face a united Republican legislature for his final two years in office. In many ways, this legislative election turned on issues central to her campaign."}

Gillespie may have won more than twice as many counties as Northam, and Republicans increased somewhat their winning margins across a broad western and southern swath of rural and small-town Virginia. But there was little sign of the Donald Trump surge that swept across GOP strongholds just a year ago and raised Republican hopes statewide. Bigger 2017 wins for Democrats are shown as blue lines tilted left, while bigger wins for Republicans are red lines tilted right. Democrats bettered their showing by 12 percentage points or more in about 30 percent of the state's precincts. Republicans did so in about 20 percent of precincts. Where Trump performed far better than Mitt Romney, Gillespie grew the Republican margin by almost eight percentage points compared to the 2013 governor's race. Northam beat his predecessor by more than 10 points in similar areas. Tuesday exit polls suggest Trump was likely a factor in both. More than 1 in 3 voters said they voted to show opposition to the president, while almost 1 in 5 say they did it in support. Margins grew by 10 points in Hispanic neighborhoods. In predominantly white neighborhoods, the large political divide remained about the same, with Democrats and Republicans dividing up the votes that went to third-party candidates back in 2013. Northam increased the Democratic win to 63 percent, up by almost 10 points. Gillespie gained five points in neighborhoods where most adults stopped their education at high school. According to statewide exit polls, Clinton lost the white college-educated demographic in Virginia by four points last year, while Northam won it by three. Tuesday's signs of growing enthusiasm among Democrats in the Trump era could herald challenges next year for Republicans in swing areas. In Virginia's 10th Congressional District, for example, Republican Barbara Comstock last year won another term, but Clinton finished ahead of Trump there. On Tuesday, seven Republican incumbents in the state legislature with districts touching Comstock's were defeated by Democrats. In Loudoun County, the heart of the 10th District where Gillespie three years ago narrowly won running for U.S. Senate, he lost Tuesday by more than 23,000. Precincts across the 10th District gave Northam a win of more than 55 percent on Election Day, significantly more than in the race four years ago, and built upon the same political trends seen in precincts statewide.

Politics In tight Virginia races, Democrats cutting ties to Obama By Anita Kumar October 17, 2011 ROCKY MOUNT, Va. Less than a month before critical legislative elections, several Democratic legislators say they have reservations about the president and will not commit to supporting him next year. At least one longtime state senator has announced he will not vote for Obama in 2012. House Minority Leader Ward L. Armstrong (D), who is fighting for reelection after Republicans eliminated his district during redistricting, released a TV ad in response to an attempt by his Republican opponent, Del. Charles D. Poindexter, to tie him to Obama in the Southside district. In the ad, Armstrong dismisses the notion. Recent polls and interviews with voters show that Republicans may have had some success. In 2008, Obama became the first Democratic president to carry Virginia in more than four decades, leading some Democrats to declare the state blue. Virginia is expected to remain a swing state. Even Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who barely won reelection last year, said in August that Obama would not win Virginia if the election were held now. The White House had considered stops in Danville, Newport News, Charlottesville and Fredericksburg. Instead, Obama will speak at a high school in Emporia on Tuesday, and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton and a fire station in Chesterfield County outside Richmond on Wednesday. He will be joined by first lady Michelle Obama in Hampton. Democratic legislators say they constantly hear from residents who are frustrated that Washington fails to get things done. State Sen. George L. Barker (D-Fairfax), who is in danger of losing his seat, said Republicans who supported him in 2007 have told him they will not vote for him because of Obama. Next year, when Obama is at the top of the ticket, many Democrats will have to embrace him, knowing their fates are intertwined. Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell), who faces a tough reelection battle in Southwest against Republican Adam Light, became the first Democratic legislator in the state to say he would not be supporting Obama in 2012. Puckett made his comments last month after Republicans put up billboards in his rural district showing him campaigning for Obama in 2008. In an interview with The Washington Post, Armstrong declined to say whether he would support Obama next year. Sen. William Roscoe Reynolds (D-Franklin), Sen. R. Edward Houck (D- Spotsylvania), Barker and Puller also declined to say if they would vote for Obama next year. Republican Bill Stanley, who lost his Senate seat to redistricting and moved to challenge Reynolds, has tried to push Reynolds on the subject. Comments The story must be told.

All 140 seats of the Virginia General Assembly are up for election next month, but many voters won't have much of a choice at the ballot box on Election Day. Less than half of contests for state Legislature will have more than one candidate, and only a small percentage of contested races are expected to be close. For critics of the state's current electoral map, the lack of meaningful competition is largely a symptom of what they say are unfairly drawn maps designed to benefit incumbents. In the state Senate, 22 out of 40 races have more than one candidate, but only six are expected to be close. In the House, only 38 out of 100 have two or more candidates, with only a handful expected to be competitive. The chief architect of the 2011 Republican legislative redistricting plan testified in federal court earlier this year that raw political self-interest was at work when the maps were being drawn. Del. S. Chris Jones testified that he tried to accommodate requests from 75 to 80 delegates who sought to tweak lines, sometimes to draw out precincts where they had historically performed poorly or to draw out a potential primary challenger. But those requests were made by Republicans and Democrats alike, and GOP lawmakers dispute that the current map is squelching competition. Republican Del. Greg Habeeb, said there are many factors that explain the lack of competition, and a lack of effort by the Democratic Party to recruit candidates is one of them. He noted that Republicans currently control more than a dozen House districts that President Barack Obama won in 2012. Some of those seats aren't being contested this year by Democrats. This year's lack of competition isn't a new phenomenon nor is it unique to Virginia, said Ronald L. Heinemann, professor emeritus of History at Hampden-Sydney College and biographer of U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr., whose political machine controlled Virginia politics for more than 40 years. Under the Byrd machine, legislative lines were drawn to favor rural districts over urban areas and often had to be redrawn under court order, Heinemann said. That's an outcome Democrats and some advocates are hoping will happen again. A panel of federal judges has ruled 2 to 1 that Virginia's congressional maps should be redrawn after Democrats filed a lawsuit alleging that Republicans unconstitutionally crowded black voters into one particular congressional seat.

Terry McAuliffe after a rally in Old Town Alexandria in October. McAuliffe described the elections as a life-or-death choice for his agenda. There is excitement. McAuliffe said a Democratic Senate could give him another chance at Medicaid expansion, gun restrictions and universal pre-kindergarten, which evaporated with the surprise resignation of a Democratic senator from southwest Virginia and flipped the Senate to Republican control. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a tax-increase coup in 2004. But back then, Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. Republicans today boast a supermajority in the House and hope to pick up additional seats Tuesday. For McAuliffe, winning Senate control is more about bragging rights and giving Democrats a tail wind heading into 2016, Farnsworth said. McAuliffe hopes to deliver Virginia for his close friend and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton. He could use the momentum of a Senate flip to help Clinton heading into the March 1 Super Tuesday contests. Republicans are just as keen to have that momentum on their side. Even though the electorate that turns out for off-year elections is more Republican than in presidential years, holding the Senate would feed a GOP narrative that Virginia is leaning red. The symbolic value has made the Senate contests uncommonly intense and expensive. Indeed, 17 of the 40 Senate seats are uncontested, as are 62 of 100 House slots. Democrat Dan Gecker is battling Republican Glen Sturtevant to replace retiring Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan), who represents parts of Richmond and surrounding suburbs. Two issues rose to sudden prominence in the final weeks of the campaign. Across Northern Virginia, Republicans waged a coordinated campaign against the incendiary issue of tolling Interstate 66, putting Democrats on the defensive. McAuliffe, who has said he wants to give single drivers the option of paying to drive in carpool lanes, countered with claims that Parrish and the Republicans are lying. Still, many of his fellow Democrats backed away from the plan. Anti-toll protesters greeted McAuliffe outside a rally in Loudoun on Sunday. Separately, a massive ad buy bankrolled by an independent group thrust gun control to the forefront of two hotly contested races. Gary T. McCollum had billed himself as an active member of the Army Reserve when, in fact, he had been discharged 14 years earlier. McCollum said he had misunderstood his status in the Individual Ready Reserve, which does not require regular drills. The revelation was viewed as a big blow in a district full of military veterans. Lewis is defending a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger is Republican Richard H. Ottinger. The McCollum-Lewis rally was one of nine appearances McAuliffe was scheduled to make Sunday with nine more set for Monday and Tuesday. McAuliffe and Edwards were scheduled to attend three church services, visit a diner and participate in a kickoff for door-to-door canvassing. McAuliffe also appeared with Warner at a rally on behalf of Democrat Jill McCabe, who is challenging Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun), a perennial Democratic target because of his opposition to abortion. Over the past week, six-figure donations have poured into some of those hard-fought races.

The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda. All 140 seats in the General Assembly were on the ballot. Democrats could have taken control by picking up just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). But Republicans held all of their seats. View Graphic See the full results for statewide and local races. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), meanwhile, held out hope that the results could change. He said he suspected irregularities in a Richmond-area race won by the GOP because Republican turnout was so heavy. As of late Tuesday night, Democrat Dan Gecker had not conceded to his opponent, Glen Sturtevant. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a record tax hike in 2004. But Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. McAuliffe faces a more conservative Senate Republican caucus and a House with a wide GOP majority. McAuliffe, once a record-smashing fundraiser for his close friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, had hoped a win would help sway purple Virginia in 2016. National donors and outside groups on the left and right seized on the state Senate races. Republicans and Democrats alike went into Tuesday predicting success. The party sent out a two-page memo to reporters laying out reasons why this might not be its year. It noted that Republicans tend to vote in off-year elections such as this one, that Democrats are playing in traditionally Republican districts and that money has flowed in from outside groups. Fatigue from a seventh year of the Obama White House hurts even more, Democrats said. McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, favors Medicaid expansion, gun control and abortion rights. Democrats conceded that unseating Black would be as difficult as their quest to oust incumbent Republican Frank W. Wagner in Virginia Beach. Wagner withstood a challenge from Democrat Gary McCollum. Wagner, the former owner of a ship repair company, seemed vulnerable after reports that he took gifts from special interests and sponsored legislation friendly to Dominion Virginia Power. But McCollum was stung by revelations that he misrepresented his military record. Nearby, Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack) successfully defended a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger was Republican Richard H. Ottinger. In southwest Virginia, Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) prevailed in a three-way race against Republican Nancy Dye and Democrat-turned-independent Don Caldwell. Along with gun control, highway tolls came to dominate races in Northern Virginia late in the campaign. Democratic candidates said they opposed it as well, but the GOP contended that they could not be trusted to buck a governor of their own party once in office. They used the attacks against Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) and Democratic state delegate candidates John Bell and Jennifer Boysko. Meanwhile in the House of Delegates, in preliminary returns, Republicans appeared to narrowly lose their veto-proof majority, but they still maintained a huge advantage over Democrats in the polarized chamber. House Democrats picked up two seats in districts formerly held by Republicans who did not seek reelection. Boysko defeated businessman Danny Vargas (R) for Del. Bell defeated Republican Chuong Nguyen for the seat held by David I. Ramadan (R-Loudoun). Late Tuesday, Murphy was embroiled in a tight race with Craig Parisot, the Republican she narrowly defeated in a special election last year. This time around, less than 200 votes separated the candidates, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Fairfax County officials said that they will recheck the totals for Murphy and Parisot on Wednesday to see whether a recount is warranted. Late Tuesday, Republican Mark Dudenhefer was leading Democrat Josh King to take back the seat he held for one term before losing it to Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William).

The Republican candidate in the Nov. 7 election, Ed Gillespie, is opposed to any further gun control. Everytown is supporting Northam despite the fact that the group has clashed with his ally, Gov.

Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun control group led by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, has endorsed the Democratic ticket in Virginia, but has yet to announce any donations. On the other side of the gun debate, the National Rifle Association - headquartered in Virginia - has endorsed all three Republicans running for statewide office. This is a reference to Herring's decision to stop recognizing out-of-state concealed carry permits, since reversed by McAuliffe's gun deal.

Local elections boards met around the state Wednesday to count provisional ballots and conduct what is known as canvassing, which involves reviewing calculations, tapes from voting machines and other Election Day records to make sure no obvious errors occurred. That process is expected to be completed by Thursday. The results then will be forwarded to the Virginia State Board of Elections. The board will review the results and formally certify them on Nov. 28. Only at that point can a losing candidate petition the circuit court in his home county for a recount. The candidate would have 10 days from certification to do so. A Republican pick-up of two Senate seats would divide the 40-member chamber evenly between Republicans and Democrats. Any tie votes would be broken by Bolling, a Republican. The only other time the chamber split 20-20 Democrats and Republicans split power as part an agreement with both parties sharing control of committees. Saslaw said if Houck loses, then Norment will be able to decide whether Republicans take outright control or allow the two parties to share power. The two spoke Tuesday night. Three races were too close to call, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell said late Tuesday. They repeatedly compared Virginia Democrats to President Obama, featuring him in Republican TV ads, mailers and brochures. If the Democratic-led Senate was not able to stop Republican proposals, they said, the state would move too far to the right. Republicans had the edge in nearly every other way: They raised millions of additional dollars, recruited more candidates and benefited from an increasingly unpopular Democratic president and an increasingly popular Republican governor. Republican had another advantage: more candidates. The GOP had to persuade one delegate to give up his safe House seat and a senator to move and challenge an incumbent. Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple (D-Arlington), who serves as chairwoman of her caucus, said Democrats never seriously considered recruiting candidates for more than the 22 seats they already control and the pair of new Republican-leaning districts created in redistricting. He lost. Tom Mills, retired after 23 years of service in the Army, said his anger against Obama led him to vote for every Republican he could find on the ballot at Hayfield Elementary School in Fairfax County. But former governor Timothy M. Kaine, a former national party chairman who is running for U.S. Senate next year, said Republicans tried to cast the spotlight off their own ineffective policies. He and his wife voted for Sen. George Barker, hoping not only to keep him in office but also to thwart GOP hopes for a Senate takeover. National politics Republicans began plotting their takeover in 2009 after a Democrat narrowly won a special election for a Fairfax County senate seat left vacant when Ken Cuccinelli II (R) was elected attorney general. The loss of that seat served as a wake-up call. Senate leaders sought advice from House Republicans, a more conservative group with marked electoral success, but one they had sparred with for years. They told incumbent senators to mail constituents regularly and hold telephone town halls. They hired a fundraiser and a press secretary for the first time. Republicans also kept the successful infrastructure it had in place in 2009 and 2010, including 11 offices across the state, and picked up the tab for get-out-the-vote efforts and most campaign mailers. Democrats boasted of making more than 2 million calls and door knocks through the campaign, trying to contact each potential voters three times each. Democrats were outraised but insisted they had enough money to be competitive.

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. Check out day one. In 1948, the great American political scientist V.O. Virginia now has something resembling a two-party democracy. But the system of odd-year elections for state offices distorts turnout, particularly in the growing minority population in Northern Virginia. Looking back, there are now two completely different gubernatorial races to compare to the last two presidential elections. There were vastly different campaigns in 2009 and 2013, waged by two very different candidates. We can explain an area (like Southwest Virginia) where Deeds did better but McAuliffe did worse. On election night in 2013, some may remember that votes were coming in much weaker than expected for the Democrats in Danville and a few other Southside areas. Although at first this gave reason to worry, it instead ended the night as a localized phenomenon explained by difficulties in voter turnout in the poorer, more African-American precincts of Southside Virginia. Another seat to look at is the 2nd, where Futrell was elected by just 223 votes. Deeds did not do as poorly in Danville and Southside, probably because he was running better with Southside whites and able to compensate for lower black turnout. Another cluster is in the exurbs of Stafford and Spotsylvania: 54th (Orrock), 88th (Cole), and 28th (Howell), and the neighboring 30th (Scott) in Culpeper and Orange. Finally, a red flag in this special election season, the 100th left vacant by soon-to-be State Senator Lewis. In both gubernatorial elections, Deeds and McAuliffe underperformed on the Eastern Shore. Elsewhere, the 2nd will be a tough seat to hold in 2015. And with lower turnout, the ever-elusive quest to defeat Bob Marshall may be better for 2017 than 2015. Between the Republican gerrymander, odd-year elections, and problems connecting with swing voters in competitive districts, Virginia Democrats may wish they had gotten a lump of coal for Christmas instead. Well, there are some areas where local, Virginia Democrats do better than expected, even if they are as different as Deeds and McAuliffe. But these districts are so overwhelmingly Republican that minor improvement is meaningless. These are among the safest seats out there for Democrats. Personal antics are more likely to end careers than electoral defeats. It also had a high crossover of Romney-Kaine voters. RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR 2018 Elections Midterms Matter.

Many of us have been wondering just what the DPVA will look like and how it will be functioning as we approach the November 2014 elections for the House of Representatives and the re-election of Sen. Mark Warner, given the resignations of the Executive Director, the Political Director, and the Chair. As you know, Charniele Herring is resigning to run for the 8th District seat being vacated by Jim Moran. That leaves a vacancy that needs to be filled as soon as possible, so that the DPVA can hire staff, especially a new Executive Director. I have heard that Del. Herring will continue to see that the Chair's duties are fulfilled, pending the election of a new Chair at the March Central Committee meeting. I also have heard that the selection of a new ED will be done by the incoming Chair with Steering Committee approval, which makes much more sense than Del. Herring selecting the ED. One name occurred to me - Aneesh Chopra. Former Arlington County Democratic Committee Chair Peter Rousselot has written a devastating postmortem that I can't recommend enough and encourage you to read in full if you haven't already. As for me, what I'll remember most about the 2011 election cycle is this ad from House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong trashing just about everything Democrats believe in. The leader of House Democrats - as chosen by his fellow House Democrats - distances himself from President Obama, a woman's right to choose, reasonable gun safety regulations, and limits on air pollution - all in one ad. I understand the need to emphasize different issues and rely on different messaging in different parts of the state. But if you try to run away from the leader of your party and everything your party believes in, not only are you hurting your own team, voters don't buy it. A friend pointed me to this quote from Harry Truman: I've seen it happen time after time. When the Democratic candidate allows himself to be put on the defensive and starts apologizing for the New Deal and the fair Deal, and says he really doesn't believe in them, he is sure to lose. The people don't want a phony Democrat. If it's a choice between a genuine Republican, and a Republican in Democratic clothing, the people will choose the genuine article, every time; that is, they will take a Republican before they will a phony Democrat, and I don't want any phony Democratic candidates in this campaign. Just as Harry predicted, Ward Armstrong lost anyway. And just as former Rep. Glenn Nye did last year, Armstrong managed to not just lose, but hurt the party he was supposed to be leading in the process, making Democrats look like a bunch of gutless phonies who'd throw a friend under the bus in a second if a consultant told them it might help their chances of getting re-elected. Mr. Wilder is unhappy with the condition, policies, leadership, and prospects of his party today---- in fact, with the whole shebang. Thereafter, as in other states subject to the VRA, a realignment of the political landscape began, with the shifts at first benefitting Republicans (after all, the Great Empancipator, Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican), which is how in 1969 Republican Linwood Holton was elected to the governorship. (FYI side-note: it was in 1619 that the first slaves from Africa arrived in Virginia---- the past is never really past, in the Old Dominion)."}

Partly cloudy skies after midnight. Low 69F. Winds light and variable. Well, not all voters. In the days leading up to Election Day, both parties and their out-of-state surrogates have spent record amounts in advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. McPike, 40, a volunteer firefighter from Dale City who is director of general services for the city of Alexandria, is fighting to hold onto the seat occupied since 1976 by Sen. Charles J. Colgan, D-Prince William, who is retiring. The race is one of two in swing districts considered the closest and most crucial to controlling the chamber. The other close race is in the 10th District, where Gecker, a businessman and member of the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, is battling with Republican Glen H. Sturtevant, a lawyer and Richmond School Board member, to succeed retiring Sen. John Watkins, R-Powhatan. The contest also features independent Marleen K. Durfee and Libertarian Carl R. Loser. Both parties also are taking on incumbents in races that are considered longer shots. Republicans are challenging Democrats in Roanoke, where retired surgeon Nancy Dye is taking on Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke, in the 21st District seat he has held since 1996. Republican Richard Ottinger is making a play for the 6th District seat held by Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr., D-Accomack. In January 2014, Lewis won a special election to succeed Northam by 11 votes. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to unseat GOP incumbents in Virginia Beach and Loudoun. In District 13, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician, is challenging Sen. Richard H. Black, R-Loudoun, a lawyer and former state delegate who has held the seat since 2012. In District 7, Gary McCollum, a former Cox Communications executive, is trying to unseat Sen. Frank W. Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, the former owner of a ship repair company who has held the seat since 2001. McAuliffe, along with U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, a former Virginia governor, is scheduled to make stops today on behalf of Edwards, McCabe, McPike, Lewis, McCollum and Gecker. Only 38 of the 100 House of Delegates seats have more than one candidate, and nine of those contests have only independent or third-party challengers to a Democrat or Republican. All but 11 incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Only 22 of 40 Virginia Senate races have more than one candidate, with two of the 22 featuring only an independent or third-party challenge to a sitting incumbent. All but seven incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Kidd said turnout in elections in which General Assembly contests lead the ballot has steadily declined over the past three decades, driven by gerrymandered districts that provide little or no competition to incumbents. Turnout dipped from 51 percent in 1983 to 29 percent in 2011. A recent Wason Center survey predicts turnout of between 23 and 29 percent on Tuesday. He said Republicans have the advantage going into this off-year cycle because they hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature. Given the scarcity of competition, money has poured into the few races where both parties are running robust campaigns. In addition to the Parrish-McPike race, two other Senate contests are on pace to break money records. Everytown is backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose name has been frequently invoked by the Republicans who Everytown is going up against. Kidd was less sure about whether the avalanche of political advertising in the two most closely watched races, to succeed Watkins in the 10th and Colgan in the 29th, would change the outcome. In Chesterfield, Republican Amanda Chase, who defeated 21-year incumbent Stephen H. Martin, R-Chesterfield, in a June primary, is running in a GOP-tilted 11th District race against Democrat Wayne Powell. Dye is challenging Edwards, and McCabe is challenging Black in races that are competitive but expected to lean toward the incumbents.

The attorney general said state universities will immediately implement the policy, which comes just in time for high school seniors trying to make college plans for the fall. For affected students, securing an in-state discount would remove a financial hurdle that is insurmountable for many moderate-income families. For universities, the effect is unclear because it is not known how many of the targeted students will win admission to four-year universities. This school year, there are about 137,000 Virginians who are undergraduates at public four-year universities. The issue also could prove tricky for Republicans in Virginia. In Florida, it has divided the GOP in recent years; Gov. Rick Scott (R), who is running for reelection, has supported similar legislation. Herring himself, who squeaked by Republican rival Mark D. Obenshain to win the office last fall, hails from Loudoun County, a Washington exurb that has swung back and forth in recent elections and where immigration policy has long divided voters. Similarly, his challenge to the marriage ban came as legislators made a failed bid this year to repeal it. The maneuvers have allowed him to advance Democratic priorities past a divided state Capitol and sometimes overshadow Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), whose top priority of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act is the subject of a legislative stalemate and looming government shutdown. Republicans, who have been seeking stronger ties to minority groups nationally and in increasingly diverse Virginia, were cautious in reacting to the announcement. Gregory D. Habeeb (R-Salem) tweeted. Herring sent a letter Tuesday to the presidents of Virginia colleges and universities outlining his rationale for expanding eligibility to in-state tuition. Still, his position has suddenly opened the door to a less expensive college education for thousands. The daughter of a Bolivian construction worker and house cleaner, both still illegal, she said she had been working full time since age 16 while attending high school and dreaming of attending the University of Virginia. Now, she will have a chance to realize her dream. McAuliffe offered his full support, as did Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and the Virginia Catholic Conference, a group at odds with Herring in the marriage case. Impact on schools Across the country, 19 states, including Maryland, have enacted some form of in-state tuition for qualified young illegal immigrants, spanning a variety of regions and political leanings. The others are: Texas, California, Utah, New York, Washington, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Colorado, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Hawaii, Michigan and Rhode Island. The decision could have substantial implications for Virginia colleges and universities as they prepare for an influx of students and a reduction in what some existing students are paying. In Virginia, more than 8,000 illegal youths, and in Maryland about 7,000, have been approved for temporary legal status under the federal policy. Nationwide, more than half a million applicants have won approval based on their age, length of time in the United States, clean criminal records and full-time enrollment in school. Virginia Education Secretary Anne Holton said the state ultimately will benefit financially by helping these students fulfill their potential. Nick Anderson contributed to this report.

State Board of Elections records suggest the same possibly mistaken distinctions had been used in each election since new maps were drawn in 2011. Since the electoral board had already submitted its results Monday morning before getting formal letters complaining about the issue, the statement said any changes at this point would be up to the State Board of Elections. That board is due to meet next Monday to certify statewide results. If the latest results hold, Republicans would hang on to control the House of Delegates 51-49.

But he is frustrated that the Democratic-controlled Senate killed his proposals to expand the number of charter schools, reform the retirement system and divert existing money to ease traffic congestion. A Republican victory would help McDonnell get his priorities passed, but it also could lead to a politically sensitive environment for a governor mostly regarded as a moderate who often works with both parties. The growing and more influential conservative wing of his party would want him to take on hot-button issues, such as gun rights, immigration and abortion, that he has largely avoided. But since then, Republicans have engaged in a steady march back to power. Republicans have been trying to tie Democrats to an increasingly unpopular president, saying a Republican takeover of the Senate would be a rebuke of President Obama. McDonnell, who leads the Republican Governors Association and is often mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, is barred by law from seeking a second consecutive term and has said little about his plans. Democrats hold a 22 to 18 majority in the Senate. A two-seat loss would force the two parties to share, though Republicans would have an advantage because Bolling could cast a vote to break ties. A three-seat gain would mean Republicans would have outright control of the Senate for the first time since 2007. McDonnell said he hopes a Republican Senate will help him reform the pension system, press the federal government to institute an energy plan that includes oil drilling off Virginia, and pass significant education reforms that would bring more accountability, merit pay and choice to schools. But McDonnell also likely would be forced to decide whether to sign the type of conservative bills that have been largely championed by Cuccinelli and some House Republicans. Bolling said he was frequently rankled that the Senate, despite its rules, killed some bills without giving them a hearing. He hopes that changes with a Republican Senate.

The election was marred by electoral irregularities, such as robocalls falsely telling voters their polling places had changed and voters being assigned to the wrong district. These irregularities led to lawsuits and a delay in the certification of the election results. Several candidates filed for recounts, one of which changed the result, the first time in almost 30 years that a recount in a Virginia election had done so. That recount's results were not certified, however, due to a questionable ballot; a tie was declared and a random drawing gave the seat to the pre-recount leader. 35 races were uncontested in the general election, with 13 having only a Republican candidate and 22 having only a Democrat. On January 4, 2018, the drawing was held and Republican David Yancey was declared the winner. There were several notable candidates who won elections. Virginia Department of Elections.

Young people offer unique attributes that could energize Virginia elections and the political process: Young people are more likely than other age groups to be unaffiliated with a specific party and want candidate interaction beyond just party identification. Studies show active young voters influence members of households to go and vote. Inspire Virginia is working to transform the way the youth vote is viewed; we must empower every eligible high school student to vote as soon as they are eligible. In August, Inspire Virginia brought together 60 students from 18 different high schools in six different counties, including Washington-Lee High School in Arlington. Inspire Virginia recruits three or four exceptional leaders in partner high schools across the state. We educate, train, and ultimately, inspire these student leaders to return to their schools and mobilize their peers to participate in the democratic process. Our mission is to inspire student leaders in each high school across the state to register every eligible student and empower those students to vote. In the weeks since the summer conference, Inspired Leaders have worked to register 172 voters, and nearly 900 of their peers have pledged to register when they become eligible. These 1,072 youth votes are just the beginning. Virginia law allows 17 year-olds to register and vote in primary elections as long as they will turn 18 by the general election. For 2016, that means many seniors can register and vote in both the March presidential primary and the June primary for Congress and other offices. Our state, by incorporating the collective youth demographic into Virginia civic life, will reinvigorate an elections process that has been criticized as stale and ineffective. This is why Inspire Virginia is working to register thousands of new, interactive voters across the state. We hope you will join us in welcoming and supporting these new additions to the electorate. For more information, visit our website. Isabel Alcalde and Alex Chandler are Program Coordinators for Inspire Virginia. Inspire Virginia is the seventh state chapter of Inspire US, a unique program dedicated to supporting students in a year-long civic experience. target drunken driving in campaign through Labor Day weekend Virginia Md.

Her description of her busy days is utterly no-nonsense. By the way, he was a military prosecutor when he made those statements. JG: This is your first time running for office. As a pediatric emergency physician, part of our mission is to advocate for families. Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam recruited me this spring. There are no doctors in our state senate right now. I get him up and get him there or in the car pool. Early morning is a good time to connect with the night-shift people. Then, I am at meetings at the hospital. At the end of the day, one of the things we do is have dinner at home whenever we can. We try to squeeze in 30 minutes of check-in time with the kids, talking at the dinner table. In the evening now, I either knock on doors or go to a campaign event. I get home between nine and ten. My husband is the associate deputy director of the FBI. He has an equally demanding job. Right now, the state legislature has 19 Democrats and 21 Republicans. The Republican majority is preventing Medicaid expansion from happening. Without Medicaid expansion, our state is not getting a lot of funding we can really use. Many of the people affected by Medicaid not expanding are employed. The more and more data we have shows that people are healthier with insurance coverage, which ultimately reduces costs too. This race is also important because it highlights the unreasonable views of my opponent. The more people get to know me, and the more people get to know the views of my opponent, the more they like me. It is very poorly written and uses adjectives and verbs that are extremely immature. You really should have reconsidered posting this one. The remark about his name is childish, at best. Definitely not a characteristic of a leader. The English department is calling, they are asking for your diploma back. Score 1 point for improper grammar. The statement was made when attempting to help AGAINST rapist. The comment about Senator Black's name is incredibly disrespectful and immature. Wow. Obviously Lena Dunham understands the ins and outs of this race, and is an authority you should cite. I guess Senator Black should just decide he's a doctor too. Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. Very unprofessional and very presumptuous. Good job, there's one vote who can't even vote for you. You know a lot about a person by the company they keep. I want nothing to do with someone who touts an endorsement from a sick woman who molested children. McCabe anywhere near my children knowing this). Maybe getting up at 4:30 am has ruined your brain. As a psychologist, I think this shows a bit of delusion on her part. Just for your information, Senator Dick Black is our Senator, the year is 2015, and the election has not yet been held. Get some more sleep....and take some meds. Shame on you for lying to the voters of the 13th District. Staying home November 3rd. Is so, well done. The vast vast majority of reasonable people who outnumber the kooks above 1000 to 1 are the people who will decide this election..and for that I am thankful. You ran for office because someone you have never met asked you to. You are posting an article by someone who doesn't know you are not a senator. I don't care what your children are doing. I don't care when and what you eat for breakfast or dinner. Talk real. That speaks volumes. Tell us a bit more about your FBI husband and his cover up of how he helped get Hilary Clinton off the hook. If anyone believes a Democrat is good for business thye need to have their head examined, but this one is mixed up in all kinds of dirt.

Astrid Riecken Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Gregory S. Schneider , Reporter Laura Vozzella , Reporter Fenit Nirappil , Reporter November 8, 2017 Democrat Ralph Shearer Northam won a hard-fought race to become Virginia's 73rd governor, beating Republican Ed Gillespie in an election watched around the nation as a judgment on President Trump and the politics of polarization. Voters chose Northam, the lieutenant governor, 54 percent to 45 percent over Gillespie as part of a stunning Democratic sweep of statewide offices, including lieutenant governor and attorney general. There also were widespread Democratic victories in the House of Delegates. The vote had national resonance as well. Gillespie, in turn, had dipped into Trump's playbook with strong law-and-order messages, but tried to keep his distance from the president in a state that now leans blue. Social media reaction Wednesday framed the Virginia governor's contest as a bellwether of the sentiments across the country, as some people predicted it was also a sign that the GOP faces big trouble ahead. Many voters said they were simply relieved that the election and its ads were over. Democrats at the Northam campaign party in Fairfax City broke into tears as results came in Tuesday evening, the outcome beyond what most had dared hope. For all the fury unleashed on the Virginia races by Trump and his followers, who lit up social media and tried to define the contests in terms of Confederate statues and Hispanic street gangs, Northam had seemed an unlikely standard-bearer to fight back. Even some fellow Democrats had criticized Northam for his low-key campaign style. But in the end, he won more votes than any previous Virginia governor, and it was a historic night for the party across many fronts. Voters energized by last fall's demoralizing loss by Hillary Clinton came out in large numbers to elect Democrat Justin Fairfax as lieutenant governor over Republican state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Fauquier), making Fairfax the first African American elected to a statewide office in Virginia since L. Douglas Wilder won as governor in 1989. Democratic Attorney General Mark R. Herring was reelected over Republican challenger John Adams. And Democrats were poised to pick up at least 14 seats in the House of Delegates after fielding a historic number of challengers, many of them women. Among them is Danica Roem, who defeated longtime Republican incumbent Robert G. Marshall in Prince William County to become the first openly transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature. Six more House seats were in play as of late Tuesday, with four of those headed for recounts. The Democrats needed to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the House of Delegates. That would be a stunning turnaround in a body where Republicans had a seemingly insurmountable 66-to-34 advantage. All 100 seats were up for election. Whether you voted for me or not, we are all Virginians. As he has traveled the country, McAuliffe said, the pressure from other Democrats to perform in this election has been enormous. The victors basked in the idea that they had just shown something to the nation. Gillespie, 56, was gracious in defeat, taking to the stage at a hotel outside Richmond to congratulate Northam and pledging to help the new governor in any way he could. Gillespie never mentioned Trump during his concession speech, just as he almost never mentioned him on the campaign trail. But the president was quick to lash out earlier Tuesday as it became clear that Gillespie was losing. He was referring to the MS-13 street gang, which featured prominently in Gillespie ads raising fears of violence and illegal immigration. Preliminary exit poll results found 28 percent of voters identifying as liberals, up eight points from the 2013 governor's race and two points from last year, when Clinton won the state by five points. Democrats composed 41 percent of the electorate, up four points from 2013 and one point from last year. Republicans were 31 percent of the electorate, a record low in exit polling dating to 1996. African Americans accounted for 21 percent of voters, according to exit poll results, identical to their share in last year's presidential election and one point higher than in 2013. In total, nonwhite voters made up 33 percent of the electorate, the same as last year but up from 28 percent in the previous governor's race. Black voters favored Northam over Gillespie by a 73-point margin, while Hispanic voters favored Northam by 33 points. Democrats had worked feverishly in recent weeks to court African American voters, and former president Barack Obama held a rally with the ticket in Richmond last month. Obama also recorded a robo-call that went out Monday and Tuesday to encourage people to vote. As the national Democratic Party has wrestled with fractures in recent weeks, the Virginia party may have offered a lesson in how to move ahead. After former congressman Tom Perriello mounted a progressive challenge to Northam for the Democratic nomination and lost, he became a foot soldier for Northam in the general election. Northam also may have benefited from the historic number of Democrats who challenged Republican incumbents in House of Delegates races. Their presence on the ballot helped bring out voters in districts all over the state who otherwise might have had little interest in a nonpresidential election. Republicans, on the other hand, failed for most of the year to project the same kind of unity. Gillespie ran a restrained primary race and nearly lost to rival Corey Stewart, who fully embraced Trumpian bombast and made defending Confederate statues and fighting illegal immigration into central issues. After the primary, Stewart refused to endorse Gillespie unless the candidate adopted his hard-right agenda and style. Gillespie gradually leaned in that direction as it became clear that he needed to firm up his base, especially in rural areas, but Stewart never campaigned for him. The governor's race had been close in pre-election polling, and Northam had been criticized by some in his party for waging a subdued campaign at a time of high passion and sharp rhetoric. But Virginians turned out in large numbers on a day of patchy rain around the state as Northam and the Democrats relied on an increasingly efficient system for getting voters to the polls, especially in the more-populous parts of the state. Gillespie ultimately failed in his attempt to walk a very fine line, working for votes in a state where his party's president is deeply unpopular. But Gillespie made a late turn toward Trumpian tactics that seemed to energize his campaign, promising to defend Confederate heritage and airing ads that seemed to equate illegal immigrants with violent gangs. The Trump factor drove an unusual amount of national attention toward Virginia, whose election was one of only two statewide contests in the country. The other, in New Jersey, was not considered competitive, so Virginia became the proxy for the painful efforts by both major parties to find their way forward in the age of Trump. Pat Sullivan, Sarah Gibson, Rachel Chason, Antonio Olivo, Maria Sacchetti, Julie Zauzmer, Shira Stein, Jenna Portnoy, Scott Clement, Emily Guskin, Dana Hedgpeth and Kristen Griffith contributed to this report.

Here's what the Election Day outcome suggests for Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's political future, Virginia's role in the 2016 presidential campaign, and the role of heavy spending outside groups in Virginia. McAuliffe took advantage of Virginia's limitless campaign finance system to raise money from Democratic mega donors around the country while spending heavily on data-driven voter identification and turnout. His unsuccessful push to flip the Senate reduces his already slim chances of passing legacy-defining legislation during his tenure, said Bob Holsworth, a consultant and retired Virginia Commonwealth University political analyst. Holsworth noted that the chances of McAuliffe passing some of his top legislative priorities, like Medicaid expansion, with the House in firm GOP control were already slim. And McAuliffe, nearly halfway through his term-limited four year stint, has made clear that he is less interested than some of his predecessors in the legislative process and prefers to spend his time trying to lure businesses to build and expand in Virginia. With little hope for major Democratic-leaning legislative successes, McAuliffe will be free to focus even more on economic development efforts. On Wednesday, both Democrats and Republicans were claiming that the 2015 legislative elections have helped them prepare for next year's contest. Democratic Party of Virginia spokeswoman Morgan Finkelstein said the 2015 Democratic ground game collected valuable data on Virginia's ever-shifting voting population. Voter turnout will likely be significantly higher and the electorate much different next year than it was Tuesday, when unofficial turnout was 26 percent of registered voters. Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University, said Tuesday's results reflect that Virginia continues to be an evenly split state. Republicans were shocked at the amount the billionaire's group was putting into Virginia, but the spending did not appear to have made any difference, said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. One Bloomberg-backed candidate won in a Northern Virginia district that has voted reliably Democratic by large margins in past elections while the other Democratic nominee lost in pivotal swing-seat in the Richmond area.

Low 71F. Winds SW at 5 to 10 mph. Well, not all voters. In the days leading up to Election Day, both parties and their out-of-state surrogates have spent record amounts in advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. McPike, 40, a volunteer firefighter from Dale City who is director of general services for the city of Alexandria, is fighting to hold onto the seat occupied since 1976 by Sen. Charles J. Colgan, D-Prince William, who is retiring. The race is one of two in swing districts considered the closest and most crucial to controlling the chamber. The other close race is in the 10th District, where Gecker, a businessman and member of the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, is battling with Republican Glen H. Sturtevant, a lawyer and Richmond School Board member, to succeed retiring Sen. John Watkins, R-Powhatan. The contest also features independent Marleen K. Durfee and Libertarian Carl R. Loser. Both parties also are taking on incumbents in races that are considered longer shots. Republicans are challenging Democrats in Roanoke, where retired surgeon Nancy Dye is taking on Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke, in the 21st District seat he has held since 1996. Republican Richard Ottinger is making a play for the 6th District seat held by Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr., D-Accomack. In January 2014, Lewis won a special election to succeed Northam by 11 votes. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to unseat GOP incumbents in Virginia Beach and Loudoun. In District 13, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician, is challenging Sen. Richard H. Black, R-Loudoun, a lawyer and former state delegate who has held the seat since 2012. In District 7, Gary McCollum, a former Cox Communications executive, is trying to unseat Sen. Frank W. Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, the former owner of a ship repair company who has held the seat since 2001. McAuliffe, along with U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, a former Virginia governor, is scheduled to make stops today on behalf of Edwards, McCabe, McPike, Lewis, McCollum and Gecker. Only 38 of the 100 House of Delegates seats have more than one candidate, and nine of those contests have only independent or third-party challengers to a Democrat or Republican. All but 11 incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Only 22 of 40 Virginia Senate races have more than one candidate, with two of the 22 featuring only an independent or third-party challenge to a sitting incumbent. All but seven incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Kidd said turnout in elections in which General Assembly contests lead the ballot has steadily declined over the past three decades, driven by gerrymandered districts that provide little or no competition to incumbents. Turnout dipped from 51 percent in 1983 to 29 percent in 2011. A recent Wason Center survey predicts turnout of between 23 and 29 percent on Tuesday. He said Republicans have the advantage going into this off-year cycle because they hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature. Given the scarcity of competition, money has poured into the few races where both parties are running robust campaigns. In addition to the Parrish-McPike race, two other Senate contests are on pace to break money records. Everytown is backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose name has been frequently invoked by the Republicans who Everytown is going up against. Kidd was less sure about whether the avalanche of political advertising in the two most closely watched races, to succeed Watkins in the 10th and Colgan in the 29th, would change the outcome. In Chesterfield, Republican Amanda Chase, who defeated 21-year incumbent Stephen H. Martin, R-Chesterfield, in a June primary, is running in a GOP-tilted 11th District race against Democrat Wayne Powell. Dye is challenging Edwards, and McCabe is challenging Black in races that are competitive but expected to lean toward the incumbents.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

As is our custom, we had him on our show the day after the election. He was very gracious, as was senator-elect Amanda Chase last June and E.W. Jackson two years ago. Our three wrong picks in four years: McPike, Chase and Jackson. And there is no truth to the baseless rumor that I am a shameless self-promoter... Jeremy McPike Manassas GOP Mayor Hal Parrish ran the best race in the history of the Virginia state senate -- and still got creamed by McPike. This youthful fellow with a young family relates to average folks and has a very bright future in Virginia. Watch him. Another young-gun Democratic senator-elect to watch: Scott Surovell (D-36). They were outspent, out-gunned, out-manned and out-resourced by the state Democrats, but their strategic savvy and steady hand saved the day for the GOP. Together they staved off what should have been a banner night for the Democrats. Powatan voters provided senator-elect Glenn Sturtevant (R-10) with a huge plurality that sunk solid Democrat candidate Dan Gecker. Whitbeck, RPV Chairman, took over a skeleton organization last January that was tens of thousands of dollars in debt and had no viable fundraising apparatus in place. Whitbeck ran this campaign with only a handful of full-time staffers and a few contractors. They were up against a juggernaut: the revitalized Democratic Party of Virginia machine that has 70 full time field staff and a seasoned crackerjack state staff of political veterans in Richmond. Somehow Whitbeck held his state party together and kept the senate in GOP hands. Corey Stewart Unbelievable. The mainstream media missed it. Corey Stewart, a conservative Republican defeated his Democratic opponent 57-43 percent for re-election to Chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors. Stewart is the conservative. Parish is the moderate. Conventional wisdom says the numbers should have been reversed. It only gets better for Stewart. Go figure. The veteran chairman of the board of supervisors said he proved how conservatives win over minority voters in Democratic strongholds. Pete Snyder Other people talk. Pete Snyder shows up and gets his hands dirty. Joseph Yost won a tough re-election. The entrepreneur has also been a key part of turning the RPV around and Snyder is one of the few people in the party with a true statewide presence and tons of credibility in both the grassroots and the business community. Many in the grassroots of the Republican Party think so and say Snyder needs to run for the top spot in 2017. We think so too. You heard it here first. His rout last week in SD-6 outpaced Ralph Northam. Their data collection and analysis is second to none, the dividends of which will pay off long after McAuliffe leaves office. Long-term, the RPV is severely over-matched. Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) See above. Good luck beating Northam for Governor in 2017. The Virginian-Pilot The Pilot was a big winner Tuesday as it somehow repositioned itself as an authority in Virginia politics once again. Their political team, led by veteran reporter Bill Bartell, established its dominance during this cycle by providing compelling news coverage at the national and state level. Newbie Richmond correspondent Patrick Wilson is an up and comer. Walker was my go-to guy for Virginia politics. I got up at 3:15 a.m. It was my routine. Wilson has a chance to fill that void. Editorial page editor Donald Luzzatto, a generally predictable and reliable Leftie, deserves optimum kudos for one of the best candidate endorsement editorials written for his cogent piece on the Frank Wagner (R) vs. Gary McCollum (D) race in the senate district 7. It inspired my faith back in the Pilot for one, and newspapers in general. Great work, Don. Trent Armitage The political director of the Virginia House Democratic caucus Trent Armitage deserves a lot of credit for gaining one net seat last Tuesday. These were hotly contested House seats he was charged to win. In two weeks, Armitage went from plus five to minus three to an actual plus one. A roller-coaster ride the young Democratic operative navigated successfully. He won everything. Mason will rise. It looked a little shaky last week. Laura Vozzella This cycle established Laura Vozzella, who covers Virginia politics for the Washington Post out of Richmond, as a must read. Her coverage of the election was extensive, fair and thorough. McAuliffe put his political capital, his PAC money and his national prestige on the line to win back the Virginia state senate. He threw down the gauntlet. He lost. His strategy was singularly focused on turning out a minority voting bloc, ignoring a large swath of interested and engaged voters in his district. McCollum's campaign epitomizes why average folks loathe politics. McPike was going to win anyway. It sunk Gecker and the Virginia Democrats, and cost them the state senate. Epic fail. Got The Shaft Dick Saslaw Plain and simple, the Godfather got the shaft. He should be Majority Leader come January 2016. John Fredericks is a Virginia radio talk show host."}

The message from Democratic voters, who came out in droves for an off-year election, was loud and clearly aimed at the president. Even though Northam and his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, sought to distance themselves from Trump during the fall campaign, voters used the opportunity to make a statement. They not only elected a Democratic governor by the largest margin in a generation but also defeated a slew of Republican state legislators. A transgender political neophyte, Danica Roem, knocked off one of Virginia's most prominent social conservatives, Robert G. Marshall, who had insisted on referring to her with male pronouns throughout the campaign. A daughter of a Salvadoran immigrant defeated a 30-year Air Force veteran incumbent who won previous elections by positioning himself as a moderate Republican who cherished civility. Caption Voters in Virginia elected Democrat Ralph Northam over Republican Ed Gillespie as the next governor. Astrid Riecken Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. But while Democrats swept races for New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and all three statewide posts in Virginia, Tuesday's vote offered no definitive guidance about whether the torrent of anti-Trump votes can translate into an effective strategy for Democrats in swing or red states in next year's congressional elections. No Republican has won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009, and what was long considered a swing state is now represented by two Democratic senators, has elected Democratic governors in four of the past five cycles, and is governed by a legislature that took a big step back from Republican dominance toward relative balance Tuesday. Some Democrats cheered the Virginia results as a sign of things to come, noting that 23 House Republicans hold seats in districts Democrat Hillary Clinton won last year. But others warned that the Virginia results may say little about Democratic appeal beyond the mostly coastal states where Clinton did well. The Democrats are just going after the heavily populated areas and the college graduates. The shape of Northam's victory gave Democrats both hope and pause. He drew larger portions of the vote than Clinton did in every region of Virginia, outperforming her especially among young people and white women with college degrees, according to preliminary exit polls. But Northam failed to make gains in Democratic weak spots such as with rural and less-educated voters. The Virginia vote left both parties deeply divided. Despite the win, Democrats remain split between those who thought Northam's moderate approach and quiet manner provided a welcome salve to Trump's disruptive style, and others who argued that the Democrats would have done far better had they taken a more confrontational, progressive- populist approach in the style of Bernie Sanders or Northam's primary opponent, former congressman Tom Perriello. Gillespie, the consummate establishment figure, was a D.C. lobbyist and former head of the Republican National Committee, and he for a time led the party's effort to reach out to Hispanics and diversify the base. But this fall, he sought to pitch himself to Never Trump moderates as a serious advocate for tax cuts even as he rebranded himself for the Trump base as a fire-breathing fighter defending Confederate monuments and attacking criminal gangs of undocumented Hispanic immigrants. The Trump voters are still important, but they weren't enough to win here last year, and they certainly weren't enough tonight. But there was no sign Tuesday night that the president or his supporters were eager to shift course. It's up to the Republicans in Congress. Even amid their evening of celebration, some Democrats worried that the Virginia victory would mask the fact that the party has still not found a way to connect with voters between the coasts. On paper, a Democratic victory may have seemed inevitable in Virginia. The history and math were lined up solidly against Gillespie and the Republicans. Virginia was the only Southern state Clinton won last year, Trump remains deeply unpopular there, and Virginians have a long history of turning against the party of the new president. Northam's path to victory was pocked with land mines. But despite Gillespie's aggressive ad campaign, which slammed Northam as soft on pedophiles and too lenient toward the Latino MS-13 gang, Democrats came out in force to make their statement. Virginians weren't buying it. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

Dick Howard is not among them. Howard is the University of Virginia law professor who in 1996 wrote a legal opinion saying the lieutenant governor has the power to cast a tie-breaking vote on anything before the Senate. Howard stands by his 15-year-old legal opinion. But in an interview Monday, he described it not as legal gospel so much as a very educated guess. A legal scholar who was chief draftsman of the state constitution when it was revamped in 1971, Howard was tapped to help the Senate organize itself in 1996, the only other time the chamber was evenly split. The lieutenant governor has, by custom and tradition, always cast the tie-breaking vote on ordinary legislation, Howard said. But Howard said he later concluded that the lieutenant governor had unlimited voting authority. That debate could move to court now that Democrats are threatening to sue the GOP for the right to share control. The party announced its intention on Monday but declined to say when it plans to file the suit, what court it will file in or even disclose its attorney. The dispute leaves control of the chamber in doubt less than two months before the General Assembly returns in January for its 60-day session. But Sen. Ryan T. McDougle (Hanover), chairman of the Republican caucus, said a judge cannot wade into the issue because of the separation of powers between branches of government. Democrats, who had 20 senators and the lieutenant governor, intended to rely on it to control the chamber. But Sen. Virgil H. Goode Jr., a Democrat who later switched parties while serving in Congress, would not agree to the reorganization unless Republicans shared power in the chamber. The two parties shared control for four years. But he said he does not know whether he can vote on the budget, tax bills, bonds, constitutional amendments and judges. His staff indicated last week that it thought he could, but Bolling said Monday that he is doing more research.

Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) would be speaker if Republicans maintain control. With four races still too close to call, both parties are bracing for the messiest of all outcomes: a dead-even 50-50 split that requires power-sharing and a potentially ugly fight for the speakership. That would be triggered if Democrats pick up one of the four races that are close enough for a state-funded recount. Republicans have leads difficult to overcome in three of them, including Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax), who narrowly pulled ahead of his challenger after unofficial results were tallied. Del. David Yancey (R-Newport News) is just 12 votes ahead of Democratic challenger Shelly Simonds, with provisional ballots still being counted through Monday. Control of the chamber has implications for policy decisions affecting large swaths of Virginians, including whether Medicaid is expanded to an estimated 400,000 low-income residents and new gun control measures are implemented. Even if Democrats fall short, they have other options to take control of the legislature. They can lure Republican lawmakers to their side with the promise of plush committee assignments, or government jobs or Cabinet positions offered by Governor-elect Ralph Northam (D). But the GOP House leadership said their majority is secure because they are confident Yancey will hold his seat. Unlike the state Senate, where the lieutenant governor breaks ties, there is no such mechanism in the House. Virginia last saw an even split in the House of Delegates in 1999. Democrats held on to the speakership with a parliamentary maneuver, while committees that serve as gatekeepers for legislation were led by two chairs, one from each party. Political observers say that managing the battle for control of the legislature will be Northam's first chance to show leadership, with an opportunity for bipartisanship and to strengthen his negotiating hand. Unlike the man he is replacing, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), Northam has relationships with Republicans in the legislature stretching back a decade, to when he first became a lawmaker. He was so well-regarded by Republicans, in fact, that they tried to coax him into changing parties as part of a plot to take control of the Democratic state Senate. Democrats don't have all the leverage if control of the House of Delegates is in play, strategists said. Under one scenario, the Republicans could delay seating Simonds, if the Democrat prevails in a recount against Yancey, in time to elect a speaker of their own. A spokesman for Northam declined to tip his hand on how the future governor would maneuver to turn the General Assembly blue, but said he would be true to his campaign promise of working across the aisle. Republicans hold a 21 to 19 edge in the state Senate, with Lt. Gov.-elect Justin Fairfax (D) set to preside over the body and break ties. That happened in 1998, when then-Gov. Jim Gilmore (R) appointed a Democratic senator as his deputy transportation secretary, handing control of the Senate to Republicans as a result. And in 2014, Virginia Republicans took control of the Senate after Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell) resigned amid talks of a job with a state tobacco commission. Regardless of the parliamentary maneuvering and who ends up in power, Virginia Republicans are entering a new administration with far less clout than they had before Election Day. Albo, the retiring Republican lawmaker who will be replaced by a Democrat, lamented the vanishing breed of districts with voters willing to split their ballots. Gregory S.

Kirk Cox, who Republicans expect to install as the new speaker of the House in January, said in a statement that the state board does not have the right to hold up certification of the 28th and 88th District races. On Monday, the board delayed certifying the vote until at least Wednesday in the hopes of getting more answers about at least 83 Fredericksburg voters who were assigned to the wrong House district. People associated with Democratic campaigns in Stafford County and Fredericksburg have suggested there could be even more voters who were assigned to the wrong House district. Registrars outside of Fredericksburg told WTOP there is no reason to believe that voters elsewhere in the state were similarly assigned to the wrong House district. But State Board of Elections Vice Chair Clara Belle Wheeler urged officials statewide to double check their district lines to ensure that everyone in the state received ballots for the correct races as described by Virginia code. The board must certify results before candidates who lost by less than 1 percent of the votes cast could request recounts. Democrats expect to request recounts in three races where the margins are 10 votes, 82 votes and 106 votes.

Cole, R-Spotsylvania, 2nd from right, and others on HB1280 dealing with primary dates in June, during a meeting of the committee at the General Assembly Building in Richmond, VA Friday, Jan. 23, 2014. Cynical lawmakers in Richmond seem determined to keep democracy nothing but an aspiration in the commonwealth. Turnout in legislative-only contests for the General Assembly has fallen dizzyingly, to less than 29 percent in 2011 from 49 percent in 1991. Virginians stay away from the elections for an excellent reason: They are shams, engineered by insiders as festivals of incumbent protection. Of the 200 races for the state House of Delegates in 2011 and 2013 combined, just 17 were competitive, meaning a victory margin of less than 10 percentage points. In 129 of those 200 races, the winning Republican or Democrat faced no opposition from the other major party. And in the 71 contests where a Democrat and Republican did square off, most were blowouts, with an average victory margin of 20 percentage points. Those lopsided results are no accident in a system where elected representatives get to handpick their voters through computer-assisted cartographical sleight of hand. The way to fix this is by reforming the process by which legislative districts are drawn, as a number of states have done. Nonpartisan redistricting commissions can fashion electoral maps that will yield many more genuinely competitive races and many more districts that are compact and contained, not squiggly scrawls of tortuous lines. That sort of reform has been endorsed by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and pushed by some lawmakers of both parties. But the status quo serves so many incumbents, especially Republicans who enjoy an overwhelming majority in the House of Delegates, that there seems little prospect of establishing an independent commission any time soon. A champion of the dysfunctional status quo is Del. Mark L. Cole (R-Spotsylvania), who has had only token opponents or none at all since he was elected in 2001. Using a similar degree of reason, Mr. Cole, who chairs the House committee that oversees electoral issues, said reform is a low priority because the next redistricting is five years off. Given current trends, perhaps Mr. Cole will be happy when turnout falls below 20 percent, or even below 15 percent, and incumbents are simply returned to office by unspoken consensus.

Robert F. McDonnell (R) blamed Democrats for delaying the budget as they sought more power in the chamber and more funding for their priorities. The governor thanked Colgan, the longest-serving state senator in Virginia history, for his vote. Sen. Harry B. Blevins, R-Chesapeake, left, greets Sen. Charles J. Colgan, D-Prince William, the only Democrat to vote for the budget bill, which passed the Senate on April 18. Blevins had to rush back from caring for his ill wife to cast his vote. Normally game to hold forth for the media, Saslaw had little to say, walking directly from the Capitol to the General Assembly office building without stopping to talk to reporters, who trailed him to the building. He said he pondered the implications of not having a spending plan. Colgan, a former World War II pilot, had decided before each of his past three elections that he was going to retire, but he was persuaded to run each time by Democratic leaders, including former governor Timothy M. Kaine and Sen. Mark R. Warner. A moderate Democrat and committed Catholic, he sometimes crosses party lines to vote with Republicans, particularly on abortion issues, but he has been a stalwart Democratic vote on fiscal issues. The spending plan the Senate approved Wednesday did not include the Dulles rail money but pumps tens of millions more into local governments, public schools, hospitals and nursing homes than the original proposal.

The Republican-led House of Delegates overwhelmingly passed the bill Tuesday, paving the way for the new budget to go into effect at the start of the fiscal year, July 1, a relief to state and local agencies. McDonnell will have seven days after receiving the budget to recommend amendments. But they agreed to allow localities to spread the cost of new pension regulations over years. But most of the attention Wednesday focused on the state budget, which pays for everything from prisons to road maintenance and colleges. The spending plan came just in time. On Tuesday, as he was weighing how to vote, Colgan also had asked McDonnell for a letter stating his support in principle to the Dulles rail project. McDonnell produced a letter, one that satisfied Colgan. McDonnell sent another letter to Colgan on Wednesday that simply confirmed support for the Dulles rail project, but did not promise additional money. That was enough for Colgan. Senate Republicans needed at least one Democratic vote in the evenly divided chamber to approve the budget. Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R) can break tie votes, but not when it deals with the budget. Legislators tried, but failed, to override several vetoes, including one that would have increased penalties for Virginia residents who failed to register their cars in the state and another that would have allowed those who live within homeowner associations to qualify for federal tax credits by installing solar panels. They agreed to technical amendments that would gives tax credits to those who donate private- and parochial-school tuition to students, which Democrats said would undermine public education.

Democrat Danica Roem, a former journalist, is set to make history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a state legislature in the United States. Roem will be the first transgender member of the House of Delegates and will become the first out transgender person to win and serve in a state legislature, according to the Victory Fund, a political action committee that works to get openly LGBTQ people elected and has supported Roem. She says she has refused to accept money from Dominion Energy, which she says has too much influence over lawmakers. Roem started pursuing therapy to begin her gender transition when she was 28, and said in an interview with The Associated Press during the campaign that politics should be inclusive of all. She also argued that Marshall, who has served in the House since 1992, has spent too much time on social policy. A lightning rod for controversy, Marshall often drew the ire of even his own party. Roem, who sings in a metal band in her spare time, said she learned to listen to different perspectives and digest complicated policy as a reporter for the Gainesville Times and Prince William Times, skills she would bring to bear as a delegate.

He said that it is possible that more voters could have cast ballots in the wrong race in Stafford County and Fredericksburg. The State Board of Elections made the unusual decision to delay certifying results in the two races for several days while Democrats file lawsuits. In the 88th District, Republican Mark Cole easily won re-election. But in the 28th District race to replace retiring House Speaker Bill Howell, Republican Bob Thomas leads Democrat Joshua Cole by 82 votes, according to the results presented to the Board of Elections on Monday. The ballot problems date back to an unexplained change made in April 2016. Several Republican party leaders told the Board of Elections the results should have been certified. The Republican appointee to the board, Clara Belle Wheeler, urged all of the registrars and other elections officials in the room to go back to their jurisdictions and ensure no other voters were incorrectly assigned to the wrong district elsewhere in the state. However two Fredericksburg residents working with the Cole campaign said they have uncovered additional mismarked district lines. In two other tight House races, the Board of Elections certified the results allowing the Democratic candidates who trail in the contests the right to file for a recount. Just 10 votes separate the candidates in the 94th District in Newport News. And in the 40th District, covering parts of Prince William and Fairfax counties, 106 votes separate the candidates. A three-judge panel would oversee each recount. Republicans would control the House of Delegates 51-49 if recounts do not change the results certified by the board or the results in the 28th District.

On Saturday, she was out at 5 a.m. to greet a search-and-rescue team returning to Fairfax County from Nepal. Later she would head to a festival in McLean and attend a gala for brain-tumor research. The district Comstock represents is notoriously independent, swinging back and forth in the past few elections. Republicans have only a slight edge, and in a hotly contested presidential race, Democrats can overcome it. Turnout in midterm elections favors Republicans; in a presidential year, Democrats do better. Virginia will be a key battleground for both parties next year. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, is already recruiting volunteers in the state. She also has assembled a campaign team with many ties to the commonwealth. Two Republicans are retiring in Democratic-leaning state House districts in the area; so is a longtime Democratic state senator. If 2016 is a better opportunity for Democrats, it might also be their last unless future redistricting changes the lines. The longer Comstock spends in office, the stronger her ties will grow to a district that values constituent service over partisan identification. Federal workers and contractors made up a large proportion of the population; so do immigrants. In 2008, voters there narrowly supported President Obama; four years later they supported Mitt Romney. Comstock is following the model that made Wolf impossible for Democrats to unseat despite an increasingly amenable electorate. On pay for federal employees and funding for regional transportation, she has bucked her party. She voted against all three Republican budget proposals earlier this year, saying they were too cruel to federal workers. Democrats counter that Comstock far more often votes with Republicans, including this week for a late-term abortion ban and against allowing young illegal immigrants to serve in the armed forces. Wolf was just as conservative on abortion and immigration. His appeal lay in his clout and commitment when it came to regional concerns. A savvy and inexhaustible campaigner, Comstock is trying to cultivate the same loyalty, even though she lacks the seniority her predecessor held. Several Democrats have named two possible recruits they see as strong: Shenandoah University professor Karen Schultz, who came close to winning an expensive state Senate race in 2007, and Cate Wyatt, a former state secretary of commerce who now works on historic preservation. Also mentioned are state Sen. Jennifer T. Wexton and state Rep. Kathleen Murphy, though both say they are focused on winning reelection this fall. Democrats had hoped for a competitive race in this narrowly Republican district in 2014, when Wolf retired after three decades in office. Instead, they suffered a disastrous loss. Both sides say that Fairfax County Supervisor John W. Foust was mortally wounded by a clumsy comment he made a few months before the election. It was a missed opportunity for Democrats, but it was also just the first round.

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. It may seem as exciting as a lump of coal, but the Republican gerrymander in the House of Delegates gets a lot of attention from thankful Virginia Democrats. Because these district lines have become the perfect excuse for the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad performance of House Democrats in 2013. I am not a fan of the use of the gerrymander as a crutch, but in the spirit of Christmas I will concede that it is a contributing factor to the difficulties of House Democrats. But a comparison with their peers in the State Senate also shows deeper concerns for Virginia Democrats. There are two more marginally Obama districts held by Republicans (7th, Wagner; and 10th, Watkins), and another one won by Tim Kaine (17th, Reeves). Senate Democrats had no way of knowing how the 2012 election would end up, so we should look at 2008. They then had a handful of marginal districts (10th, Watkins; 17th, Reeves; 13th, Black; 20th, Stanley; and 7th, Wagner). Democrats tried with their first map (drawing a safely Democratic 8th District in the Richmond area, and a more competitive 7th in Virginia Beach), but that got shot down as too partisan by Governor Bob McDonnell. That map probably would have created 21 safely Democratic seats, plus any upside from keeping around Puckett, Houck, and Reynolds. If only that has passed. There are only two Republican delegates representing districts that are this Democratic in 2012: Rust (86th) and Ramadan (87th). The 2nd district in Prince William is a good district for Democrats to analyze for the future. The former have been screwed in redistricting, but both have failed to find ways to win in less than overwhelmingly Democratic districts. Right now, Republicans in the General Assembly simply outcompete and outperform their Democratic opponents among the narrow sliver of swing voters in most competitive districts.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Bill Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Both candidates emphasize kitchen-table issues such as economic development and education. But sharp ideological differences were on display last week as they appeared at a candidate forum. Sturtevant emphasized the need to reduce tax and regulatory burdens on businesses. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

On the ballot, Virginia's election was about the state's future and who would assume a slew of elective offices, from governor to attorney general to seats in the House of Delegates. Yet a year after Trump won the White House, voters in Virginia said in post-election interviews that their choices were shaped more by their attitude toward the president than any candidate close to home. Ask them to identify an issue championed by Gov.-elect Ralph Northam (D), and they may fumble for an answer. Ask them the name of the man who was elected lieutenant governor and they might have to think for a moment. Ask them to identify who they chose for the House of Delegates, and they were likely to reply with a blank stare. But ask them why they voted Democratic, and their answers were precise and infused with anger. Her husband, Mike Potts, 51, a software process engineer, regards himself as a fiscal conservative and a loyal Republican who researches candidates before voting. But he chose only Democrats on Tuesday, and said he didn't need to study the candidates' biographies or positions. The fact that they weren't Republicans was all he needed to know. The Republicans aren't giving us any. I'm protesting and it feels good in the sense that I'm registering my concerns about it. His sentiment was shared by Democrats, who said they were focused more on who they were opposing than who they were supporting. But in this case, no. Northam is a soft-spoken man who twice voted for President George W. Bush and was little known before his bid to succeed Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). Yet the governor-elect was the recipient of more votes than any candidate in the commonwealth's history of gubernatorial campaigns, and he got more votes than any Virginia Democrat in the past 32 years. But Connolly said Democratic victories in the legislative races, as well as the top statewide contests, represent a consolidation of Democratic power, particularly in Northern Virginia, where Republicans were trounced. But it wasn't a mindless reaction to Trump. Not in all cases. Even if they reject Trump, several voters said they remain open to Republican candidates. It's his personality, not what he's doing. Paul Gallagher, 51, a consultant who lives in Lorton, also voted for Gillespie even though he dislikes Trump. Gallagher, who prefers to support candidates on a case-by-case basis, said that the 2016 presidential election was when he used his vote to send a message. He rejected Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton and supported Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Martin Andrews, 66, a retired contracting purchaser who lives in Fairfax Station, said he voted for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, but said he used his vote for Northam to convey his unhappiness with how Trump comports himself. Dave Hughes, 59, a Web designer who lives in Springfield, said he was more focused on Washington than Virginia as he voted for Northam on Tuesday.

Day one focused on challenges facing Virginia Democrats in competitive districts, Day two focused on problems with turnout. I represent poor choices, mistakes, and questionable judgment. Let us travel first to 2009, the year in which eight Democratic incumbents were defeated during a landslide Republican election. And elsewhere, incumbent Democrats dropped left and right, for a total of eight defeated incumbents, including some by the narrowest of margins: Mathieson by 14 votes, Valentine by 209, Nichols by 269, and Vanderhye by 422. Connie Brennan ran against Republican Matt Fariss, who had a questionable legal record. There was blood in the water, but unfortunately the district had been heavily gerrymandered. A good lesson on just how difficult it is to change the dynamics of a race, even with a questionable candidate. Decide for yourself. In 2013, the party again highlighted a challenger in the 6th District. Party insiders widely believed that Democrat Jonathan McGrady was going to defeat Republican Jeff Campbell for the open seat. The 6th District is heavily Republican. It would have been a significant coup if McGrady had pulled off an upset, so much so that leading by double digits should have been a very questionable poll result. But if that were truly the case, the poll should also have produced bizarre results in the top of the ticket, either showing McAuliffe winning or competitive with Cuccinelli. This is inexcusable for a professional political polling firm; they were allowed to do so by the House Caucus and its outgoing director, Jody Murphy. Also in 2013, long time incumbent Republican Joe May was defeated in his primary by conservative Tea Partier Dave LaRock. Democrats had hopes for their candidate, Mary Daniel, to win against the out of touch LaRock. It would have been a significant gamble to bet that just being an outspoken and offensive Tea Partier could cost LaRock the race in this heavily Republican district. Boysko of course lost by 32 votes after a recount, Bell lost by 195 votes, McPike lost by 234, Murphy lost by 431, Qarni lost by 498, Farinholt lost by 537, Miller lost by 634, and Harder lost by 892. As I leave you to ponder these lessons from the past, consider this future possibility. Republican State Senator Emmett Hanger is being targeted by the far right over Medicaid expansion. The State Senate majority depends on Phil Puckett. Democrats need to challenge more competitive districts as an insurance policy. RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR 2018 Elections Midterms Matter.

Frank R. Wolf, the Republican incumbent who is retiring. A primary, open to all, could attract a more mainstream pool of 25,000 or 30,000 voters. Only ideological purity matters; moderates need not apply. The 10th District sits atop Virginia like a crown, stretching across Loudoun, Fairfax, Prince William, Fauquier, Clarke and Frederick counties. Mitt Romney, a Republican, won the district by a single percentage point last year. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D) won it by a similar margin the same year. Mr. Wolf has survived in office for 17 terms as a moderate, downplaying social issues like abortion and gun control. Evenly divided among Republicans, Democrats and independents, the 10th District seems a particularly bad place to engineer the selection of a hard-line conservative candidate. We do care about democratic principles. Conventions, which systematically exclude thousands of otherwise willing voters, are un-democratic. They make no provision for absentee voting, which means that active-duty military members serving overseas or away from home cannot take part. They are generally held on Saturdays, which makes participation difficult for owners of stores and other small businesses, not to mention soccer moms and dads. Ordinary Virginians who would like to exercise their prerogative as citizens but cannot spare an entire day sitting in a high school gym are out of luck. One prominent Republican took himself out of the running this month. Artur Davis, formerly a Democratic congressman in Alabama, had moved to Virginia with an eye to running to succeed Mr. Wolf.

This gets a bit complicated, and could also have major ripple effects on control of the House of Delegates and possibly the State Senate as well. A few points to keep in mind. Republicans currently hold a narrow, 21-19 advantage in the State Senate. Since Democrat Justin Fairfax will be Lt. Governor, a 20-20 tie in the State Senate would likely give effective control of the State Senate to the Democrats. That would seem to give an edge to Del.

Robert F. McDonnell (R) blamed Democrats for delaying the budget as they sought more power in the chamber and more funding for their priorities. The governor thanked Colgan, the longest-serving state senator in Virginia history, for his vote. Sen. Harry B. Blevins, R-Chesapeake, left, greets Sen. Charles J. Colgan, D-Prince William, the only Democrat to vote for the budget bill, which passed the Senate on April 18. Blevins had to rush back from caring for his ill wife to cast his vote. Normally game to hold forth for the media, Saslaw had little to say, walking directly from the Capitol to the General Assembly office building without stopping to talk to reporters, who trailed him to the building. He said he pondered the implications of not having a spending plan. Colgan, a former World War II pilot, had decided before each of his past three elections that he was going to retire, but he was persuaded to run each time by Democratic leaders, including former governor Timothy M. Kaine and Sen. Mark R. Warner. A moderate Democrat and committed Catholic, he sometimes crosses party lines to vote with Republicans, particularly on abortion issues, but he has been a stalwart Democratic vote on fiscal issues. The spending plan the Senate approved Wednesday did not include the Dulles rail money but pumps tens of millions more into local governments, public schools, hospitals and nursing homes than the original proposal. State employees, college faculty and some local government workers would get a one-time 3-percent bonus in December and a 2-percent raise in 2013 if revenue remains at projected levels. The Republican-led House of Delegates overwhelmingly passed the bill Tuesday, paving the way for the new budget to go into effect at the start of the fiscal year, July 1, a relief to state and local agencies. McDonnell will have seven days after receiving the budget to recommend amendments. But they agreed to allow localities to spread the cost of new pension regulations over years. But most of the attention Wednesday focused on the state budget, which pays for everything from prisons to road maintenance and colleges. The spending plan came just in time. On Tuesday, as he was weighing how to vote, Colgan also had asked McDonnell for a letter stating his support in principle to the Dulles rail project. McDonnell produced a letter, one that satisfied Colgan. McDonnell sent another letter to Colgan on Wednesday that simply confirmed support for the Dulles rail project, but did not promise additional money. That was enough for Colgan. Senate Republicans needed at least one Democratic vote in the evenly divided chamber to approve the budget. Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R) can break tie votes, but not when it deals with the budget. Legislators tried, but failed, to override several vetoes, including one that would have increased penalties for Virginia residents who failed to register their cars in the state and another that would have allowed those who live within homeowner associations to qualify for federal tax credits by installing solar panels. They agreed to technical amendments that would gives tax credits to those who donate private- and parochial-school tuition to students, which Democrats said would undermine public education.

Asked how he would persuade the legislature to double the minimum wage, he said he would campaign against Republicans who opposed it. But in a post-election radio interview, he didn't offer a specific number when expressing support for raising the minimum wage. Illegal immigration issues Northam supports issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants in Virginia, as well as in-state tuition for students who were brought to the country illegally as children. That angered supporters on the left, who disrupted his Election Night victory speech. View Graphic Virginia general election guide Single-payer health care Northam has resisted calls in his party to support a government-run, single-payer health-care system, which have been louder outside of Virginia. While 11 Democratic House of Delegates candidates expressed support for single-payer, only one was elected: Lee Carter. Taxes Northam campaigned on overhauling Virginia's tax system, but said he would leave the details up to a bipartisan commission. Northam's only specific campaign tax proposal was phasing out sales taxes on groceries paid by low-income Virginians. Since his election, Northam also suggested exempting military pensions from state taxes. Higher education Northam's signature campaign policy proposal was offering free community college or apprenticeships to Virginians. It comes with several caveats: It's limited to those seeking training in high-demand fields including cybersecurity and early-childhood education, and would require a year of public service. Few campaign finance reform advocates see this as feasible, given how Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike benefit from corporate and large contributions. He also wants to end the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court fees, which critics says locks people into a cycle of poverty. Northam did not call for legalizing marijuana sales for recreational purposes, as is allowed in eight states. Voting rights Northam has backed a repeal of Virginia's requirement that voters present identification to cast ballots, and he wants to establish same-day voter registration and no-excuse early voting. But he hasn't called for automatic voter registration, which has been a priority for progressives nationwide. Northam also wants to standardize a process for restoring voting rights to felons who complete their sentences, building on outgoing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's work to restore rights to roughly 160,000. Now he says he wouldn't meddle with local decision-making. He touted the board of visitors at Virginia Military Institute, whose members he will appoint as governor, as an example of local decision-makers who grappled with a Confederate-era statue and chose to keep it up. Environment Northam has said he would support two natural gas pipeline projects set to cross through Virginia if state and federal regulators find they meet environmental and safety standards. He also says he would oppose drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's coast. He also says he would support a dedicated funding source for WMATA, the regional transportation agency that runs Metro, but hasn't backed the regional sales tax favored by District leaders. But Republicans pressed Northam on whether his tune would change with a Democratic legislature. Democratic House leadership has expressed little interest in reversing the right-to-work law.

The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda. All 140 seats in the General Assembly were on the ballot. Democrats could have taken control by picking up just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). But Republicans held all of their seats. View Graphic See the full results for statewide and local races. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), meanwhile, held out hope that the results could change. He said he suspected irregularities in a Richmond-area race won by the GOP because Republican turnout was so heavy. As of late Tuesday night, Democrat Dan Gecker had not conceded to his opponent, Glen Sturtevant. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a record tax hike in 2004. But Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. McAuliffe faces a more conservative Senate Republican caucus and a House with a wide GOP majority. McAuliffe, once a record-smashing fundraiser for his close friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, had hoped a win would help sway purple Virginia in 2016. National donors and outside groups on the left and right seized on the state Senate races. Republicans and Democrats alike went into Tuesday predicting success. The party sent out a two-page memo to reporters laying out reasons why this might not be its year. It noted that Republicans tend to vote in off-year elections such as this one, that Democrats are playing in traditionally Republican districts and that money has flowed in from outside groups. Fatigue from a seventh year of the Obama White House hurts even more, Democrats said. McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, favors Medicaid expansion, gun control and abortion rights. Democrats conceded that unseating Black would be as difficult as their quest to oust incumbent Republican Frank W. Wagner in Virginia Beach. Wagner withstood a challenge from Democrat Gary McCollum. Wagner, the former owner of a ship repair company, seemed vulnerable after reports that he took gifts from special interests and sponsored legislation friendly to Dominion Virginia Power. But McCollum was stung by revelations that he misrepresented his military record. Nearby, Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack) successfully defended a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger was Republican Richard H. Ottinger. In southwest Virginia, Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) prevailed in a three-way race against Republican Nancy Dye and Democrat-turned-independent Don Caldwell. Along with gun control, highway tolls came to dominate races in Northern Virginia late in the campaign. Democratic candidates said they opposed it as well, but the GOP contended that they could not be trusted to buck a governor of their own party once in office. They used the attacks against Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) and Democratic state delegate candidates John Bell and Jennifer Boysko. Meanwhile in the House of Delegates, in preliminary returns, Republicans appeared to narrowly lose their veto-proof majority, but they still maintained a huge advantage over Democrats in the polarized chamber. House Democrats picked up two seats in districts formerly held by Republicans who did not seek reelection. Boysko defeated businessman Danny Vargas (R) for Del. Bell defeated Republican Chuong Nguyen for the seat held by David I. Ramadan (R-Loudoun). Late Tuesday, Murphy was embroiled in a tight race with Craig Parisot, the Republican she narrowly defeated in a special election last year. This time around, less than 200 votes separated the candidates, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Fairfax County officials said that they will recheck the totals for Murphy and Parisot on Wednesday to see whether a recount is warranted. Late Tuesday, Republican Mark Dudenhefer was leading Democrat Josh King to take back the seat he held for one term before losing it to Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William).

Democrats had a tall order in this off-year election, needing a net gain of one Senate seat in three targeted races while defending three others that Republicans and their out-of-state allies also spent millions to challenge. Democrats also invested heavily in two unsuccessful challenges to Republican incumbents. The GOP also came up short in expensive bids to take down two Democratic senators. Retired surgeon Nancy Dye failed to unseat Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke. Turnout is always the challenge in an off-year election and has hovered in the last two such cycles at below 30 percent. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, 62 of 100 House of Delegate elections were uncontested, as were 17 of 40 Senate races.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E.

I want to believe the Governor and the Attorney General can work this out and find the way to resolve it by issuing an executive order that requires the new photo IDs contain sufficient information to allow a voter to vote. As I discussed in an earlier post about this absolutely inane law, the code was crafted in an effort to suppress the vote through subtle intimidation. The offending affirmation on the application for the ID appears to have been removed. But as of now, the new ID is insufficient to allow Virginia citizens their right to vote. They are also required to bring an item that shows they live at the address where they are registered. So despite my adamant opposition to this law, it is time to call upon Governor McAuliffe to make it less wrong. Issue an executive order that directs the new identification card contain sufficient information to allow one to vote. Yes, this will increase the lifetime cost of the statute because some of these voters will move and will require a new ID.

Of course, things could change in the next 60 days or so, but right now, this is how we see the Virginia races for Governor, Lt. Governor and Attorney General. One important point we can't emphasize enough: in no way, shape, or form should a string of good poll results or a relatively optimistic forecast lull us into complacency. To the contrary, our goal right now should be to redouble our efforts for the final stretch, helping elect not just Terry McAuliffe, Ralph Northam and Mark Herring, but also as many Democratic House of Delegates candidates as possible.

The attorney general said state universities will immediately implement the policy, which comes just in time for high school seniors trying to make college plans for the fall. For affected students, securing an in-state discount would remove a financial hurdle that is insurmountable for many moderate-income families. For universities, the effect is unclear because it is not known how many of the targeted students will win admission to four-year universities. This school year, there are about 137,000 Virginians who are undergraduates at public four-year universities. The issue also could prove tricky for Republicans in Virginia. In Florida, it has divided the GOP in recent years; Gov. Rick Scott (R), who is running for reelection, has supported similar legislation. Herring himself, who squeaked by Republican rival Mark D. Obenshain to win the office last fall, hails from Loudoun County, a Washington exurb that has swung back and forth in recent elections and where immigration policy has long divided voters. Similarly, his challenge to the marriage ban came as legislators made a failed bid this year to repeal it. The maneuvers have allowed him to advance Democratic priorities past a divided state Capitol and sometimes overshadow Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), whose top priority of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act is the subject of a legislative stalemate and looming government shutdown. Republicans, who have been seeking stronger ties to minority groups nationally and in increasingly diverse Virginia, were cautious in reacting to the announcement. Gregory D. Habeeb (R-Salem) tweeted. Herring sent a letter Tuesday to the presidents of Virginia colleges and universities outlining his rationale for expanding eligibility to in-state tuition. Still, his position has suddenly opened the door to a less expensive college education for thousands. The daughter of a Bolivian construction worker and house cleaner, both still illegal, she said she had been working full time since age 16 while attending high school and dreaming of attending the University of Virginia. Now, she will have a chance to realize her dream. McAuliffe offered his full support, as did Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and the Virginia Catholic Conference, a group at odds with Herring in the marriage case. Impact on schools Across the country, 19 states, including Maryland, have enacted some form of in-state tuition for qualified young illegal immigrants, spanning a variety of regions and political leanings. The others are: Texas, California, Utah, New York, Washington, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Colorado, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Hawaii, Michigan and Rhode Island. The decision could have substantial implications for Virginia colleges and universities as they prepare for an influx of students and a reduction in what some existing students are paying. In Virginia, more than 8,000 illegal youths, and in Maryland about 7,000, have been approved for temporary legal status under the federal policy. Nationwide, more than half a million applicants have won approval based on their age, length of time in the United States, clean criminal records and full-time enrollment in school. Virginia Education Secretary Anne Holton said the state ultimately will benefit financially by helping these students fulfill their potential. Nick Anderson contributed to this report.

On the Democratic side, meanwhile, two Asian American Democrats ran and fell short in the primaries, as did several women and African American candidates. The Democratic candidates nominated in competitive races Tuesday were entirely white and male. And if they figure out how to do it, the Virginia GOP could become a model for other crucial swing states where minority voters can make or break the outcome of elections. Both the Hispanic and Asian populations in the state are growing, especially in Northern Virginia. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), for instance, won his election in 2013 by a margin of just 54,000 votes. Not only do Republicans want to capture at least some sliver of this population, but they also want to signal to younger white voters that the party is inclusive. Two Republican women were nominated in Senate contests Tuesday and are expected to win in November. A third is challenging state Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke), who is vulnerable in a three-way race that includes an independent who could steal Democratic votes. In Loudoun County, Vietnamese immigrant Chuong Nguyen is running for the seat being vacated by Del. David I. Ramadan (R). Korean American Sang Yi is challenging Del. David L. Bulova (D) in Fairfax. All three districts have significant Asian and Hispanic populations. And in all these cases, along with a supervisor race in Fairfax, Republicans quickly rallied around their minority candidates, rather than throwing them into tough primaries. There is no stronger sign of the importance of minority voters to politicians than the growing number of community events and ethnic festivals appearing on the schedules of both Republicans and Democrats. Last year while on the congressional campaign trail in Northern Virginia, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) hopped from Latino-heavy Manassas to Indian and Pakistani festivals to the Vietnamese-dominated Eden Center shopping mall in Falls Church. A handful of officeholders also attended, including Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D), state Sen David W. Marsden (D-Fairfax) and Fairfax Board Chair Sharon Bulova (D). One wore a straw hat; another carried a handheld fan. They greeted constituents and visited food booths, sampling spring rolls and talking to the crowd. On stage, several of them attempted broken phrases of Korean and Spanish. Several Democrats were particularly bothered that the establishment rallied around Jeremy McPike for an open Senate seat in Prince William County over Atif Qarni, a math teacher and former Marine who entered the race first and with stronger fundraising. Minority communities have long felt taken for granted by a party that overwhelmingly wins the support of blacks, Latinos and Asians year after year. The open seat in Prince William, being vacated by Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D), is a rare swing seat on the edge of the D.C. region. Qarni said he thinks that some local party leaders were concerned that his Muslim religion would hamper his bid. In a 2011 Senate race, party leaders favored Arlington County Board member Barbara A. Favola (D) over lawyer Jaime Areizaga-Soto. According to a local blogger, she noted in a phone conversation that there are few Latinos in the district. Del. Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William), who is African American, got little support before his surprise victory in a 2013 House of Delegates race. In the D.C. suburbs, so many offices are held by Democrats that turnover is rare and open seats attract multiple strong candidates. Lacking the internal ideological divisions that have bedeviled Republicans in the state, Democrats rarely challenge incumbents. She noted that the county party has two Hispanic candidates and one African American competing this fall: two for school board and one challenging Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax). In local races across Northern Virginia, four women and two African Americans were elected. Democrats remain the far more diverse party. Twenty of the 23 nonwhite state lawmakers in office are Democrats. Democratic districts, too, tend to be less white. The party is fielding a female challenger against Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun) and an African American man to take on Sen. Frank W. Wagner (R-Virginia Beach). In the Richmond area, two African American candidates were nominated for open House seats. Democrats are also rallying nonwhite voters via the legal system. Elizabeth Koh contributed to this report. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

When Sanders lost, Murillo switched to Donald Trump, the other guy he figured would step up for regular people. It was all very exciting, a show that just kept on going. For a while, he even felt hopeful. Now, Murillo knows Virginia is electing a new governor in three weeks, but he's paid little attention. Virginians speak of being exhausted by events. They say that they have only so much bandwidth and that President Trump takes up most of the space they allot to politics. They say they haven't heard much about the governor's race in the news, which seems devoted mainly to the president's doings and sayings. But far fewer Virginia voters are closely following the campaign than at similar stages in the past three gubernatorial elections, according to Washington Post polling. View Graphic Virginia general election guide Even those who might be assumed to be searching for a way to send a message about a president they consider inept or dangerous say they are paying little attention to the Virginia race. Cox, 35, usually follows campaigns for governor closely, taking weekend time to thoroughly research the candidates' views. Not this year. Virginia's unusual practice of picking a governor the year after presidential elections has historically led to low turnouts; in 2013, a year after 71 percent of Virginia voters cast ballots for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, only 43 percent came out to the polls to choose Democrat Terry McAuliffe as governor over Republican Ken Cuccinelli II. Former vice president Joe Biden and Ralph Northam in Reston, Va., on Oct. 14, and Vice President Pence and Ed Gillespie in Abingdon, Va., on Oct. 14. This year's highly polarized politics have led activists on both the pro- and anti-Trump sides to anticipate stronger than average engagement in the governor's race, if only as a proxy by which voters could express their views on the president. Both parties are eager to urge Virginians to see the governor's race through a national prism; Obama and former vice president Joe Biden are campaigning for Democrat Ralph Northam, and Vice President Pence appeared with Republican Ed Gillespie on Saturday, as Trump may yet do later in the month. Northam, the lieutenant governor, and Gillespie, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, are both more moderate in their politics than the most popular figures in their parties. Compared to the candidates both parties put up for governor four years ago, Northam and Gillespie seem like throwbacks to a quieter, gentler time. But in past governor's races, Republicans have proved themselves more likely than Democrats to vote in off-year elections. Voters in both primaries last spring chose milder, more moderate alternatives to more populist candidates, Democrat Tom Perriello and Republican Corey A. Stewart. And even some voters who have paid little attention to this year's campaign say they're in the mood for something a bit less volatile. Patrick Day, a 35-year-old teaching assistant at a Virginia Beach elementary school, said he got caught up in the frenzy of last year's election and voted for Trump mainly as a way of rejecting Clinton. Despite his eagerness to shift directions, Day hasn't paid much attention to the governor's race. It just never ends with our president. If he wouldn't talk or tweet, he'd be a lot better. Veterans of Democratic and Republican campaigns alike say they are seeing voters step back from the battlefield. Nationwide, the number of reporters covering state houses plummeted by 35 percent from 2003 to 2014, according to the Pew Research Center. The trend has continued since then, as has the shrinking of overall staffing and space for news in many papers. The result, some say, is a campaign that gets less coverage than many Virginia voters are accustomed to seeing. Jill Mulhall, a freelance editor who lives in Bristow in Prince William County, usually relies on local news outlets such as InsideNoVa.com and the Gainesville Times, as well as Facebook, to learn about the candidates.

Observers are keeping a close eye on Central Virginia where several primaries have seen an influx of money and attention from national political figures. With the balance of power in Congress at stake, November's midterms are seen by some political analysts as a test of President Trump's popularity, since traditionally the president's party loses a number of seats. This CBS 6 Primary guide aims to provide voters with helpful information before heading to the polls and takes a look at the major primary contests in Central Virginia. Virginia voters are allowed to vote in only one political primary when multiple primary elections are held on the same day, according to the Virginia Department of Elections. Voters get to choose in which primary they vote. The deadline to request an absentee ballot for Tuesday has passed, but in-person absentee voting is still open through Saturday, June 9. Voters who wish to cast in-person absentee ballots must go to their local registrar office during business hours. On Tuesday, voters cast ballots at their usual polling place and must present a valid photo ID, per Virginia law. Republican Senate Primary (Statewide) Three Republicans will be on the ballot to challenge Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat, this November. Corey Stewart, who narrowly lost the Republican gubernatorial primary to Ed Gillespie in 2017, is the at-large Chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors. State Delegate Nick Freitas (R-Culpeper) has served in the House of Delegates since 2016. Del. Freitas served as a Green Beret and gained attention earlier this year in a fiery speech on the House floor defending the second amendment following a school shooting Parkland, Fla. Democrats denounced the speech as racially charged. E.W. Jackson, a minister and conservative political commentator, shocked Virginia political observers in 2013 by securing the Republican nomination for Lt. Governor. Jackson lost that race to Virginia's current Governor Ralph Northam. WATCH: Meet the candidates: Corey Stewart WATCH: Meet the Candidates: Del.

Portions of Chesterfield, Henrico, and Spotsylvania are included in the district. In a district currently represented by Republican Dave Brat, Democrats feel they have a chance to flip the traditionally conservative district because many of the more populated voting precincts in Henrico and Chesterfield have trended blue in recent elections. Overall, Donald Trump carried the 7th District in 2016, and Ed Gillespie defeated Governor Northam in the district in the 2017 gubernatorial race, according to VPAP. Two Democrats are the primary ballot in the 7th District on Tuesday. Former C.I.A. operative Abigail Spanberger grew up in Short Pump and attended J.R. Tucker High School. Her campaign has been active on social media. Spanberger listed healthcare and gun violence prevention as the top two issues on her campaign website. Dan Ward, who served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo, is a former military adviser to President Obama. Libertarian Joe Walton and an independent Helen Alli are also running in November, but will not be on the ballot during Tuesday's primary.

Richmond, Petersburg, Colonial Heights, and parts of Henrcio and Chesterfield are included in this district currently represented by Democrat Donald McEachin. While most political analysts think the 4th District is pretty safe for McEachin, two Republicans qualified for Tuesday's primary to challenge him in November. Ryan McAdams is the Senior Leader of the Agape Mission Church in Williamsburg. McAdams' campaign site said he supported cutting bureaucratic red tape to support small business and protecting religious freedoms. Shion Fenty is the daugher of first generation immigrants and ran a design business. Fenty supports getting government out of the way of small business owners and passing a comprehensive immigration bill, according to her website.

Hanover, Ashland, and New Kent all sit within the 1st District. Congressman Rob Wittman currently represents the 1st District, and the Cook Political Report said it was likely a Republican win in November. Three Democrats will be on the ballot in the 1st District on Tuesday. John Suddarth is an Army veteran and businessman from Hanover County. Suddarth supports universal healthcare in free market, infrastructure investment, and immediate action on climate change. Edwin Santana is a Marine Corp officer and a second-generation Puerto Rican who lives in Stafford County.

Terry McAuliffe after a rally in Old Town Alexandria in October. McAuliffe described the elections as a life-or-death choice for his agenda. There is excitement. McAuliffe said a Democratic Senate could give him another chance at Medicaid expansion, gun restrictions and universal pre-kindergarten, which evaporated with the surprise resignation of a Democratic senator from southwest Virginia and flipped the Senate to Republican control. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a tax-increase coup in 2004. But back then, Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. Republicans today boast a supermajority in the House and hope to pick up additional seats Tuesday. For McAuliffe, winning Senate control is more about bragging rights and giving Democrats a tail wind heading into 2016, Farnsworth said. McAuliffe hopes to deliver Virginia for his close friend and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton. He could use the momentum of a Senate flip to help Clinton heading into the March 1 Super Tuesday contests. Republicans are just as keen to have that momentum on their side. Even though the electorate that turns out for off-year elections is more Republican than in presidential years, holding the Senate would feed a GOP narrative that Virginia is leaning red. The symbolic value has made the Senate contests uncommonly intense and expensive. Indeed, 17 of the 40 Senate seats are uncontested, as are 62 of 100 House slots. Democrat Dan Gecker is battling Republican Glen Sturtevant to replace retiring Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan), who represents parts of Richmond and surrounding suburbs. Two issues rose to sudden prominence in the final weeks of the campaign. Across Northern Virginia, Republicans waged a coordinated campaign against the incendiary issue of tolling Interstate 66, putting Democrats on the defensive. McAuliffe, who has said he wants to give single drivers the option of paying to drive in carpool lanes, countered with claims that Parrish and the Republicans are lying. Still, many of his fellow Democrats backed away from the plan. Anti-toll protesters greeted McAuliffe outside a rally in Loudoun on Sunday. Separately, a massive ad buy bankrolled by an independent group thrust gun control to the forefront of two hotly contested races. Gary T. McCollum had billed himself as an active member of the Army Reserve when, in fact, he had been discharged 14 years earlier. McCollum said he had misunderstood his status in the Individual Ready Reserve, which does not require regular drills. The revelation was viewed as a big blow in a district full of military veterans. Lewis is defending a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger is Republican Richard H. Ottinger. The McCollum-Lewis rally was one of nine appearances McAuliffe was scheduled to make Sunday with nine more set for Monday and Tuesday. McAuliffe and Edwards were scheduled to attend three church services, visit a diner and participate in a kickoff for door-to-door canvassing. McAuliffe also appeared with Warner at a rally on behalf of Democrat Jill McCabe, who is challenging Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun), a perennial Democratic target because of his opposition to abortion. Over the past week, six-figure donations have poured into some of those hard-fought races.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda. All 140 seats in the General Assembly were on the ballot. Democrats could have taken control by picking up just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). But Republicans held all of their seats. View Graphic See the full results for statewide and local races. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), meanwhile, held out hope that the results could change. He said he suspected irregularities in a Richmond-area race won by the GOP because Republican turnout was so heavy. As of late Tuesday night, Democrat Dan Gecker had not conceded to his opponent, Glen Sturtevant. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a record tax hike in 2004. But Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. McAuliffe faces a more conservative Senate Republican caucus and a House with a wide GOP majority. McAuliffe, once a record-smashing fundraiser for his close friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, had hoped a win would help sway purple Virginia in 2016. National donors and outside groups on the left and right seized on the state Senate races. Republicans and Democrats alike went into Tuesday predicting success. The party sent out a two-page memo to reporters laying out reasons why this might not be its year. It noted that Republicans tend to vote in off-year elections such as this one, that Democrats are playing in traditionally Republican districts and that money has flowed in from outside groups. Fatigue from a seventh year of the Obama White House hurts even more, Democrats said. McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, favors Medicaid expansion, gun control and abortion rights. Democrats conceded that unseating Black would be as difficult as their quest to oust incumbent Republican Frank W. Wagner in Virginia Beach. Wagner withstood a challenge from Democrat Gary McCollum. Wagner, the former owner of a ship repair company, seemed vulnerable after reports that he took gifts from special interests and sponsored legislation friendly to Dominion Virginia Power. But McCollum was stung by revelations that he misrepresented his military record. Nearby, Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack) successfully defended a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger was Republican Richard H. Ottinger. In southwest Virginia, Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) prevailed in a three-way race against Republican Nancy Dye and Democrat-turned-independent Don Caldwell. Along with gun control, highway tolls came to dominate races in Northern Virginia late in the campaign. Democratic candidates said they opposed it as well, but the GOP contended that they could not be trusted to buck a governor of their own party once in office. They used the attacks against Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) and Democratic state delegate candidates John Bell and Jennifer Boysko. Meanwhile in the House of Delegates, in preliminary returns, Republicans appeared to narrowly lose their veto-proof majority, but they still maintained a huge advantage over Democrats in the polarized chamber. House Democrats picked up two seats in districts formerly held by Republicans who did not seek reelection. Boysko defeated businessman Danny Vargas (R) for Del. Bell defeated Republican Chuong Nguyen for the seat held by David I. Ramadan (R-Loudoun). Late Tuesday, Murphy was embroiled in a tight race with Craig Parisot, the Republican she narrowly defeated in a special election last year. This time around, less than 200 votes separated the candidates, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Fairfax County officials said that they will recheck the totals for Murphy and Parisot on Wednesday to see whether a recount is warranted. Late Tuesday, Republican Mark Dudenhefer was leading Democrat Josh King to take back the seat he held for one term before losing it to Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William).

Northam also favors a ban on assault weapons, expanded background checks and wants to restore a state law that limited handgun purchases to one each month, among other measures. The Republican candidate in the Nov. 7 election, Ed Gillespie, is opposed to any further gun control. Everytown is supporting Northam despite the fact that the group has clashed with his ally, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), over a deal McAuliffe forged with Republican lawmakers to expand the rights of concealed carry permit holders in exchange for tigher restrictions on gun ownership by domestic abusers and voluntary background checks at gun shows. Northam stood with McAuliffe last year as he signed the gun compromise into law. Now, volunteers with Moms Demand Action in the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area plan to canvass and to make phone calls for Northam and other Democrats. Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun control group led by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, has endorsed the Democratic ticket in Virginia, but has yet to announce any donations. On the other side of the gun debate, the National Rifle Association - headquartered in Virginia - has endorsed all three Republicans running for statewide office. This is a reference to Herring's decision to stop recognizing out-of-state concealed carry permits, since reversed by McAuliffe's gun deal. A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association declined to comment on the ad or how much it cost. Virginia's gubernatorial contest is the nation's marquee race this year. That status, plus lax campaign finance laws, has attracted a blizzard of outside spending. Virginia's campaign finance laws allows candidates to coordinate with outside spending groups. That campaign, designed to reach more than 1.2 million voters before Election Day, will mark the first time that Democratic groups are pooling resources and data to reach voters online, organizers said.

It was the culmination of last month's Democratic wave that had diminished Republican power in purple Virginia. Democrat Shelly Simonds emerged from the recount as the apparent winner in the 94th House District, seizing the seat from Republican David Yancey. A three-judge panel still must certify the results, an event scheduled for Wednesday. Of the 23,215 votes cast in the district on Election Day, Yancey held a lead of just 10 votes going into Tuesday's recount. The final tally: 11,608 for Simonds to 11,607 for Yancey. Power sharing in the House of Delegates is an awkward exercise; the last such arrangement was in 1998. Committee chairs have to be negotiated, as does the person who will serve as speaker. With the parties split 50-50, there is no mechanism to break ties, and any legislation short of 51 votes does not advance. Republicans hold a slight 21-to-19 edge in the state Senate, but with a Democratic lieutenant governor to break ties and a Democratic governor with veto power, Republicans may be forced to advance a more bipartisan agenda. It's a dramatic shift that caught even top Democrats by surprise. Republicans have controlled the 100-seat House since 2000; even outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a cheerleader for his party, had thought the Republican edge was insurmountable. But Democrats fired up by the election of Donald Trump as president turned out in big numbers on Election Day and ran as candidates in districts that hadn't seen Democratic challengers in years. Even election officials who had spent the day keeping order seemed rattled by the fact that such a momentous race could be settled in such dramatic fashion. The adage about how every vote counts is true, said Newport News Electoral Board Chairman Sean Devlin as he announced the official result. Both sides agreed that the recount went smoothly, but as the day wore on, the humdrum trickle of a vote here and a vote there began to build to high tension. Teams of recount officials sat at four tables in the center of the room with lawyers, the news media and other onlookers kept along two walls. Workers fed paper ballots into the machines one precinct at a time. Every time the machine couldn't read a vote, it spit out the ballot. Those ballots were examined to determine whether they carried a valid vote. Of the 23 precincts, plus absentee and provisional ballots, there were only about 200 to 250 ballots that had to be examined by hand, Devlin said. Hour by hour, as each precinct was completed, workers posted the results on a whiteboard. Reporters and observers squinted to read the board and calculate what was happening to the total. Just when it seemed Simonds was eating away Yancey's 10-vote margin, the Republican picked up a handful of votes to hold her off. Attorneys for both sides, seated next to each other, were loose and joking in the morning. But after a lunch break, the mood began to turn. With only three precincts left to count, Simonds had picked up 10 votes and Yancey had picked up four, preserving his lead. Then Simonds picked up a few more. With one precinct to go, they appeared to be even. By this time, he and the other lawyers were standing, pacing, talking in urgent tones into their cellphones. A shouting match erupted over whether the volunteer observers could talk to the election officials, and Devlin told the quarreling lawyers to quiet down or go outside. At 3 p.m., Devlin told all the officials and observers to take their seats. The room had gone nearly silent, with all but one precinct in and Simonds showing a one-vote lead. Twitter was in a frenzy, but the results still weren't final. At some point, word went around that the provisional ballots had changed nothing, and Simonds's one-vote margin seemed to stand. The attorneys for Yancey edged outside with their phones. By 3:20 p.m. Devlin announced the official results. He said he accepted the outcome. The system works. Simonds had been waiting outside as the recount wound down and said she wasn't going to celebrate until she had confirmation from the registrar. Yancey, who was in Richmond at a committee hearing, can contest the results of the election with the legislature, a step that veteran lawmakers last recall happening in 1979. But GOP officials said that seems unlikely. A GOP official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Republicans weren't quite sure what the process would be for choosing the next speaker. With the chamber tied, House Clerk G. Paul Nardo, as the only sitting officer of the House, will preside over the chamber until a speaker is elected. The speakership will go to whoever can get to 51 votes first. Gretchen Heal, Yancey's campaign manager and spokeswoman, left the recount without speaking to voters and did not immediately return a text message and email seeking comment. The final makeup of the legislature is not settled. Recounts in two additional races are taking place this week: on Wednesday in Richmond's District 68, where the Democrat leads by 336 votes, and on Thursday in Fredericksburg's District 28, where the Republican leads by 82 votes. Democrats are seeking a new election in the latter because more than 100 voters were mistakenly given ballots for the wrong legislative district.

And Tom Perez personally was very active in Virginia, something we Virginia Democrats greatly appreciate. Great job, everyone. And two Latinas (Hala Ayala and Elizabeth Guzman). And many other women (e.g., Wendy Gooditis, Kelly Fowler, Karrie Delaney, Dawn Adams, Debra Rodman) and diverse candidates, including Jennifer Carroll Foy (a rising star, no doubt) and hopefully Donte Tanner (pending a recount). By the way, a shoutout to the environmental groups (LCV, etc.) who helped Democrats win last night. 10. 11. I also believe our traditional party structure deserves a shout-out. And in Fairfax County, Chair Sue Langley, Vice Chair Chris Ambrose, Executive Director Frank Anderson, Vice Chair Dan Lagana and many others did great work. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. 13. They helped elect Jennifer Carroll Foy, Chris Hurst, Elizabeth Guzman, Danica Roem, Schuyler VanValkenburg, Wendy Gooditis, Donte Tanner, Lee Carter, Adams, Kathy Tran, David Reid, Karrie Delaney, Hala Ayala, and of course Justin Fairfax. Also Shelly Simonds if that recount comes through. 14. DCCC Chair Ben Lujan: The DCCC now has much more realistic dreams of winning back a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives next year. Their fundraising and recruitment just became significantly easier. 16. Northern Virginia: It is now almost impossible for Republicans to win statewide with a fired-up, vote-rich Northern Virginia. Which is what Northern Virginia seems to be in the age of Trump. I mean, 360,000 visitors is a lot of people, especially when you consider that Northam won by under 300,000 votes, Fairfax by around 140,000 votes, and Herring by about 180,000 votes. 18. House Democratic Leadership: Several House Democratic leaders spent untold hours the past couple years recruiting candidates, training candidates, advising candidates, etc, etc. A few of those include House Democratic Leader David Toscano, Del. Charniele Herring, Del. Alfonso Lopez and Del. Rip Sullivan. This year House Democrats needed a Campaign Chair who understood the complexities of running in different parts of the Commonwealth, had the tact and open-mindedness to communicate with ALL Democrats regardless of where they fell on the progressive spectrum, had the resilience and courage to ask for the resources needed to help Democrats fund their campaigns, and never, ever gave up on his dream of achieving a majority in the HoD. A major accomplishment. 20. Medicaid Expansion and many other progressive priorities: With the Democrats having a serious shot at taking back the Virginia House of Delegates (or getting it to a 50-50 ties), Medicaid expansion looks alive again. 21. 23. Lori Haas and the Virginia gun violence prevention community: The NRA spent a ton of money in this election and had absolutely nothing to show for it. 24. Everyone who stepped up to run for House of Delegates, even in deep-red areas; Competitive Commonwealth Fund. And as Del. Women. For school board. For House of Delegates. Women knocked and dialed and texted. They drove GOTV. Women voted. In 39-degree cold and pouring rain. Women won and won big. 27. Terry McAuliffe. McAuliffe hand picked Ralph Northam as his successor, and Northam won by 9 points last night, along with a landslide for Democrats against Republicans across the board. 28. Also, Dawn Adams is openly lesbian. 2. Del. Fortunately, Lee Hockstader (of all people, given how awful he usually is) over at the Washington Post saved the day, nailing his governor, LG and AG endorsements. Check out my post on that this morning. In short, Quinnipiac and CNU did very well, Hampton did horribly, and others were in between. Badly. The only thing worse than losing an election is not being able to be proud of your effort. I mean, even their founder, Howard Dean, blasted and disowned them. Screw them. Of course, we still have corrupt slimeballs of our own like Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw to deal with, but one thing at a time I guess. Oh, also, keep in mind that with Ralph Northam as governor, Democrats will have a major say in redistricting after the 2020 census. Hahahahaha. 8. Donna Brazile: What a stupid move. The NRA: They poured money into Virginia to help their gun-loving pals Ed Gillespie, Jill Vogel, John Adams, etc. And they got their butts completely handed to them. 10. 11. 12. Second, Fairfax is opposed and Northam now has room to change the head of DEQ and demand the stream by stream crossing analysis that he SAID he would demand. But yeah, last night was not a good one for our pal Whit-less. LOL 14. Not much, from what I could tell. Other than that, you were pretty much SOL. 16. Barbara Comstock: Aside from a wipeout of Republicans last night in northern Virginia, check out the following graphic, which should send shivers up and down the spines of Comstock and her political advisors. last night, after Hillary Clinton carried the 10th CD last year. And to make matters even worse, there are a bunch of Democrats chomping at the bit, and raising shit-tons of money, for the chance of taking Comstock down next year. Republican politicians all over America. Paul Ryan should be looking over his shoulder worried about a repeat next year. As should basically every elected Republican official in America. 18. Jim Webb: The former Democratic U.S. Senator from Virginia has apparently disappeared, at least as far as helping elect Democrats in Virginia. 21. This year, he consulted to Republican House of Delegates candidate Subba Kolla against Del. LOL 22. Richard Spencer and White Supremacists. They marched in Charlottesville with their idiotic tiki torches. Their march resulted, directly or indirectly, in the death of three people and the disruption of a community. And last night, the voters of Virginia roundly rejected them. Corporate lobbyists: These guys spend years building relationships in the Virginia General Assembly, in recent years with top Republicans.

But he is frustrated that the Democratic-controlled Senate killed his proposals to expand the number of charter schools, reform the retirement system and divert existing money to ease traffic congestion. A Republican victory would help McDonnell get his priorities passed, but it also could lead to a politically sensitive environment for a governor mostly regarded as a moderate who often works with both parties. The growing and more influential conservative wing of his party would want him to take on hot-button issues, such as gun rights, immigration and abortion, that he has largely avoided. But since then, Republicans have engaged in a steady march back to power. Republicans have been trying to tie Democrats to an increasingly unpopular president, saying a Republican takeover of the Senate would be a rebuke of President Obama. McDonnell, who leads the Republican Governors Association and is often mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, is barred by law from seeking a second consecutive term and has said little about his plans. Democrats hold a 22 to 18 majority in the Senate. A two-seat loss would force the two parties to share, though Republicans would have an advantage because Bolling could cast a vote to break ties. A three-seat gain would mean Republicans would have outright control of the Senate for the first time since 2007. McDonnell said he hopes a Republican Senate will help him reform the pension system, press the federal government to institute an energy plan that includes oil drilling off Virginia, and pass significant education reforms that would bring more accountability, merit pay and choice to schools. But McDonnell also likely would be forced to decide whether to sign the type of conservative bills that have been largely championed by Cuccinelli and some House Republicans. Bolling said he was frequently rankled that the Senate, despite its rules, killed some bills without giving them a hearing. He hopes that changes with a Republican Senate.

Vogel has hammered Fairfax for calling the statues divisive and harmful, a message she has underlined at appearances before white, rural voters in southwest Virginia. More than one-third of Vogel's money came from her father, William B. Holtzman, founder of Holtzman Oil. Far more expensive, and just as politically polarized, was the campaign for attorney general, with millions of dollars of donations poured into the candidates' coffers by each party's association of attorneys general. Money came from interest groups at both ends of the political spectrum. Early in his first term, Herring refused to defend Virginia's same-sex marriage ban and joined the side challenging that ban. In his assessment, he said, the law was unconstitutional and on the wrong side of history; Adams said Herring's decision was an indefensible abandonment of the office's responsibility to defend state law. Herring also touted his record on reducing the state's backlog of untested rape kits, cracking down on gangs and leading a Medicaid fraud unit. Adams said he entered the race because he thinks Herring has turned the top legal office in the state into a partisan political operation. A conservative who opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, Adams said he would not let his beliefs affect his legal decisions or advice. Adams twice represented clients in Supreme Court cases who objected to requirements that employers provide and pay for contraceptive insurance coverage for their employees. He and Herring differed on gun control, labor union rights, immigration and most hot-button topics.

Incumbents from both parties held serve despite high hopes in a handful of targeted districts. The majority came down to a pair of districts where long-time legislators decided to retire. Republican Glen Sturtevant won the 10th District, in metro Richmond, preserving it for his party. Democrat Jeremy McPike won in Northern Virginia's 29th, doing likewise for his. That leaves Republicans with the votes to block Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's legislative package wherever they see fit. Plus, two of the three moderate Republicans who backed a quasi-privatized version of Medicaid expansion last year are retiring, leaving a GOP caucus that may have shifted to the right. Photos from around the Peninsula on Election Day 2015. (Daily Press Photo Staff) The result also takes some wind out of Democratic sails here going into the 2016 presidential elections. McAuliffe and others pointed Tuesday to the groundwork laid in voter contacts during this election, but failing to take the Senate after a major and concerted push is a blow. Complete unofficial results from the State Board of Elections show Miller with 17,981 votes, or 59.3 percent of the ballots cast, to Matney's 12,276 votes,... Seventeen of the chamber's 40 seats weren't contested this year. Most of the rest weren't considered competitive, given how well one party or the other had performed there in the past. Senate control would have given McAuliffe some leverage, but was never going to be a total game changer for Democrats because Republicans control the House by a wide margin. Democrats gained a seat there Tuesday, leaving the GOP one seat short of a veto-proof margin, but that hardly opens the door for the governor's legislative agenda. So, after weeks of intense campaigning that saw McAuliffe telling crowds that a Senate majority could help him pass gun control legislation or expand Medicaid in Virginia, the governor said hours before the results came in that the importance of control had been overstated. The governor was his optimistic self during the stop, but the state party sought to temper expectations. The memo pointed to low Democratic turnout in off-year elections, the influence of outside cash and gerrymandering as factors that needed to be overcome. But the memo's central point held true, Christopher Newport University Political Scientist Quentin Kidd said Tuesday night. Republican turnout is simply better in off-year elections, and Democrats couldn't juice their own turnout enough to overcome that, Kidd said. With Bloomberg's buy, it became the central issue. But McAuliffe said he didn't hear from voters about guns, or about tolls, an issue Republicans seized on in Northern Virginia after the administration announced a plan to toll a key highway there during peak hours. McAuliffe said Tuesday afternoon. That's what we get asked about. The governor also said he had no regrets about announcing the tolling plan about a month before the elections. Republicans turned their attention Tuesday night toward the next legislative session, which starts in January. He made no mention of the fact that McAuliffe will present his version of the budget next month. Fain can be reached by phone at 757-525-1759. Previously ... By winning a key seat opening in metro Richmond, and holding everywhere else, Republicans kept control Tuesday of the Virginia Senate. Not all returns are in around the state, but the Associated Press has called Senate District 10 for Republican Glen Sturtevant. The district, held now by retiring state Sen. John Watkins, R-Powhatan, was key for both parties. Republican Hal Parrish is narrowly leading in the state's other closely watched opening seat, Northern Virginia's Senate District 29. As of 9:10 p.m., though, only 36 percent of those returns were in. Elsewhere, incumbents appear to be holding serve, signaling that Republicans will at least hold on to their 21-19 lead in the 40 member chamber. Altogether both parties look to be holding serve in seats they already control, and the 29th is the only district left in real doubt. For example: The AP has also called state Sen. Richard Black's race. The far-right Republican was a major target for Democrats this year. State Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, has also won re-election - his current margin is more than 8 percentage points - despite a strong Democratic push for his seat. State Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, looks to be winning re-election, and Republicans had hoped an independent challenge would help them get a pickup there. State Sen. Lynwood Lewis, D-Accomack, is winning re-election comfortably. This was another seat Republicans had hoped to pick up. Previously... Gov. Terry McAuliffe, along with Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring, has been across the state today, firing up the election day troops. The group hit Roanoke, NoVa, Hampton Roads and, within the last half hour, Chesterfield County. Two years ago this trio swept Virginia's statewide offices for Democrats. Now they're hoping these locales believed to hold the key to control of the Virginia Senate. This is the Daily Press' running account of election day battles that will decide the issue. Come back for updates after polls close and follow along on Twitter. McAuliffe expressed his well-known optimism during a visit with Dan Gecker campaign volunteers just before 5 p.m. He said everywhere he's been today he's heard about high turnout, which could be a good sign for Democrats. The governor seemed taken aback by news that some have sought today to temper expectations for party gains in the Senate. The governor said the importance of Senate control to his legacy, though, has been over stated. He noted, as many others have, that Republicans control roughly two-thirds of the House of Delegates. That's not expected to change tonight. As recently as last week, McAuliffe was telling people that Senate control was hugely important, particularly as he tries to pass gun control measures and expand Medicaid. The governor also said this afternoon that he has no regrets about announcing an inside-the-beltway tolling plan about a month before the elections. Republicans seized on the issue immediately. McAuliffe has said repeatedly Republicans are lying about that plan, since tolls will only kick in at peak times and for drivers who aren't carpooling. GOP legislators and operatives have bombarded the Northern Virginia Senate district where state Sen. Chuck Colgan is retiring with ads on this issue, hoping to pick up what, statistically, should be a fairly safe Democratic seat. McAuliffe said tolls, and guns, aren't as important in these races as people are making it out. McAuliffe said. That's what we get asked about. The governor also said Democrats have made 1.3 million phone calls in the run up to election day and knocked on 700,000 doors. He called the effort, which also serves as preparation for the 2016 presidential elections, unprecedented. Polls close at 7 p.m. Fain can be reached by phone at 757-525-1759.

In both races, gun safety was either the winning factor or helped tighten a race in a previously non-competitive GOP-held district. First, polling in and outside of Virginia shows more than 85 percent of Americans support common-sense firearms-violence prevention rules such as universal background checks or keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals. That spread is the new price to be paid for sticking by the gun lobby and being out of step with Virginia voters. In Senate District 10, Republicans kept an open seat they held for 17 years. Four years ago, John Watkins won by 12 percent, 4,300 votes. While blaming one issue for winning or losing elections is an interesting political parlor game, it is a vast oversimplification for a process that divines the intentions of more than 30,000 people. The focus on gun safety actually made District 10 a tighter, tougher fight for the Republicans than it should have been, closing the gap to a spread much closer than the prognosticators were expecting. The rest of Virginia is not far behind. The D.C. sniper, Virginia Tech and the on-air assassination of Alison Parker and Adam Ward have brought firearm violence to every corner of Virginia. This is, in part, because a lot of money was spent but also because thousands of Virginians were motivated to vote for candidates willing to stand up to the gun lobby. Guns are driving people to the polls, but in a twist on conventional wisdom, the voters heading to the polls are now voting for the candidates looking for ways to reduce gun violence. In the land of the NRA, that is nothing to sneeze at. The writer, a Democrat, represents Fairfax in the Virginia House of Delegates.

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. In Virginia, politics reflects the will of business and campaign donors, and the easiest way to understand politics in Virginia is to understand that business community donors get what they want: low taxes, underfunded services, low public welfare and high corporate welfare. The Virginia Way, has always benefited aristocrats above all, whether the tobacco planters, the slaveowners, the industrialists, and now, the multinational businessmen. Read that again. For many examples, we can turn to the front pages, where the overworked and talented Virginia press corps report, again and again, on malfeasance that has become routine. Altria kills more Virginians than they employ. This is sold to the public as better for all of us and as somehow connected to a long and proud history dating back to the Founding Fathers. On a recent national good government survey, Virginia ranked fiftieth out of the fifty-one states plus D.C. on the health of our democracy, with F grades on ballot accessibility and state government representation, and a D- on political corruption. The nonpartisan group Representation 2020 ranks Virginia 40th among the states in gender equity of elected officials. Examples of corruption are usually dismissed as deviations from a glorious history stretching back to Saint Jefferson, but the deviations have themselves become the full story. It affects what they think of our present society, the responsibilities of government, and the possibilities for public policy and reform. Our education system reflects an aversion to serious examination of history and any examination whatsoever of current events. Take a look at our Standards of Learning. The program for Virginia history education mentions a tiny number of Virginians who are still living (former Governors Holton and Wilder) and whose heydays were decades ago. In 2016, a series of bipartisan bills to reduce the number of standardized tests was tabled, for no evident reason. On that same day, the same Senate subcommittee that voted against modernizing Standards of Learning voted at the behest of tourism and hotel industry lobbyists against repealing the so-called Kings Dominion law, which prohibits localities from deciding whether they can open their schools before Labor Day, the most lucrative vacation weekend. Donald Trump is right about one thing: there has been a moral decay in our society, although he is a symptom of its materialism, greed, and graft. When lawmakers are elected, lobbyist money begins to flow and helps provide a tenfold or more advantage in fundraising to incumbents. Think about that for a minute. Coupled with revisionist history is a gerrymandered incumbent protection system with no precedent in our state. Not a single decade has passed in 50 years without our legislature passing an unconstitutional plan, up to and including this one. In 2015, for the first time in history, every single incumbent who sought reelection in the general elections won: a perfect 122 out of 122. The fact that we just witnessed a landslide election for Democrats, but the House of Delegates seems to remain precisely equally divided, shows the continuing power of the gerrymander. The past several years reflect a time when Virginia politicians faced an existential moment and when the Governor was facing decades in prison for multiple felony convictions. The corrupt system continues onward. become much easier to answer. If government is for sale, then society will naturally reflect the values of the ultra-wealthy who are willing to purchase it rather than the majority of citizens who choose to dedicate their lives to family, religion, science, service or pursuits other than accumulation. Far from being anomalous, the repeated ethics and corruption scandals of recent years are microcosms of the operation of Virginia politics and government writ large. Other than the Virginia Way, the other major story in Virginia government is the counter-reaction to Dominion Energy at all levels of society. Despite this guarantee, Dominion has made a practice of overcharging Virginians by tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars every year. The State Corporation Commission, tasked with regulating state monopolies and power rates, has never once found that Dominion has undercharged. During the 2015 legislative session, Senator Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach, who lost the Republican gubernatorial primary handily this year, introduced a bill that he openly admitted Dominion lobbyists wrote and that would cancel future customer refunds from overcharging. Dominion rationalized its 2015 rate hike bill by claiming that the Clean Power Plan would lead to rate spikes for consumers, and Dominion needed the money to pay for implementation. Claiming that hiking rates would protect consumers from rate hikes seemed an audacious fallacy even by the standards of corporate politics. It further noted the consistent year-over-year declines in sulfur dioxide, mercury and nitrogen oxide emissions Dominion had achieved from 1998 to 2010 and was projected to achieve through 2015. On the contrary, it was proud. The plants were ancient, with the six units beginning operations in 1992, 1990, 1969, 1964, 1960 and, unbelievably, 1952. The plants would be closed, in decisions long predating the EPA rules that Dominion scapegoated, because they were outmoded. The facts had not changed: Dominion morphed what had been a point of corporate pride in 2010, a voluntary business decision in 2011, a rebuttal to environmentalists in 2013 and a selling point for a business-minded governor in 2014 into an oppressive government mandate in 2015 in order to sell gullible politicians on rate hikes. The refund-canceling bill passed overwhelmingly. President Trump has announced that we will not abide by the Clean Power Plan, negating the entire reason that Dominion supposedly passed this bill in the first place. While a broad examination of Virginia politics reveals the continuation of the status quo, I want to leave you with a bit of hope. There is always hope, and here, in the state of Virginia in December 2017, things are changing where they matter most, at the nexus of so many facets of the corrupt, pay-to-play system that characterizes the Virginia Way. The most significant story in Virginia politics in 2017 is not the Democratic wave election, although that is important, but the backlash to Dominion Energy, where the intersection of money and politics is at its most egregious. Thirteen candidates who made this pledge won election last month. A bloc that large is significant, can sway votes and cannot be ignored. Because of the power of incumbency, many of these thirteen people will be in office for a long time. Activate Virginia and many others wisely understand that giving money to politicians is the root of so many of the problems affecting our state government. Both Tom Periello and Corey Stewart nearly upset Ralph Northam and Ed Gillespie, respectively, only to narrowly lose their primaries in favor of more conventional candidates who supported Dominion and other corporate priorities. The people in power will never admit to being swayed by activists or so-called ordinary citizens, but they always listen to us and our criticism and protest. For the first time in history, Dominion cannot get everything that it wants. The backlash is too great; the threat is too real. Politicians with integrity are a foundational threat to the operation of the corrupt Virginia Way. Senator Chap Petersen has been leading the charge against this terrible profit-grabbing law, and I salute him for it. There are always things that people can do. Look at the present landscape of Virginia politics. There are no easy or perfect answers except to look at those problems that need to be solved but that nobody else is solving. There is a Schoolhouse Rock version of government that claims it serves people, and there is the reality that government is for sale. There is science fiction capitalism in which the unfettered free market objectively picks winners and losers, and there is actually existing capitalism where wealthy interests make money as recklessly as possible, and Uncle Sam bails them out when they go bust. In this environment, ordinary people can win significant victories. RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR 2018 Elections Midterms Matter.

VanValkenburg is part of a surge of Democratic candidates running in Virginia this fall. For Democrats, VanValkenburg and a surge of candidates like him in Virginia are part of the first major test for their party at the state level in the Trump era. At stake is whether they can take advantage of President Trump's unpopularity to gain ground in the state legislature. While Democrats hold the governor's mansion and both U.S. Senate seats and Hillary Clinton won the state last fall, Republicans hold a commanding majority in the statehouse. In addition to the statehouse races, the governor's race between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam is drawing national attention. From high school civics class to campaigning VanValkenburg, a high school government and history teacher, had never run for office before becoming a candidate for Virginia's 72nd House district. The district surrounds the suburbs of Richmond and has long been a safe bet for Republicans in the state legislature, but this year that's changing. It skirts the state's capitol, avoiding the center of Richmond and sweeping up around the suburbs. A slim majority of residents voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and then the incumbent Republican announced he wouldn't be running for re-election. Diane Robinson has lived in this district for years, but between raising three kids and working, she hasn't had time for local politics. Before VanValkenburg knocked on her door, she didn't know her current delegate was Republican. Robinson says that might have been different if a Democrat had come knocking earlier. Recruiting Democrats Across the state, Democrats are now fielding candidates like VanValkenburg in districts they previously weren't contesting. Thomas Bowman, a legislative aide for a Democratic state delegate, had long found it frustrating that Democrats weren't running in Republican-friendly districts. In October he co-founded the Competitive Commonwealth Fund, a political action committee that is donating money and expertise to candidates. The group is making it easier for new candidates running for office by paying filing fees, creating websites, and writing field plans. Bowman initially thought they'd struggle to find people willing to run. But since President Trump's victory, Democrats have had no trouble recruiting candidates. In 2015, only 39 of the 100 state legislative seats were contested. This year, 67 of the races are contested. One-party rule While that may not seem like a lot, experts say it's significant. For more than a century, Virginia's state government was controlled by a one-party political machine. When the conservative southern Democrats finally lost control of state politics in 1969, Republicans grabbed power and held it tightly. Despite the record-breaking number of competitive races, Virginia's Republican party chair John Whitbeck argues Democrats won't be able to nationalize local races. VanValkenburg, the Democrat running for Virginia's 72nd district, agrees."}

(All times local) 10:20 p.m. With all races decide, not a single seat flipped control in the Virginia Senate and Republicans retained a 21-19 lead. All incumbents won re-election and all of the open seats were won by members of the same party as those who currently hold them, after both Republicans and Democrats spent millions of dollars on several contests. In one of two closely watched open seats, Republican Glen Sturtevant kept the Richmond-area Senate seat being vacated by retiring moderate GOP Sen. John Watkins. In the other, Democrat Jeremy McPike kept a Northern Virginia Senate seat belonging to retiring Democrat Sen. Charles Colgan. In the House, the GOP maintained a clear advantage. With 84 percent of precincts reporting, McPike had 54 percent of the vote, compared to 46 percent for Parrish. The Parrish family has held elected office in Manassas and Prince William County for decades. The seat had previously been held by 89-year-old Democrat Charles Colgan, the longest serving state senator in Virginia history, who opted not to run for re-election. The district profile tilts strongly toward Democrats, and McPike ran a campaign centered on education and transportation issues. The returns show that write-in ballots, likely to be overwhelmingly cast for Euille, have received 35 percent of the vote. Silberberg won a three-way Democratic primary over Euille and former Mayor Kerry Donley. He won re-election three times. In the House, the GOP maintained a clear advantage. With Republicans maintaining control of the General Assembly, McAuliffe lost a chance to gain leverage when negotiating with GOP lawmakers on matters like the state budget during the last two years of his term. 9:15 p.m. Democrat Sen. John Edwards held off Republican challenger Nancy Dye to win re-election, a victory Democrats needed to have a chance to regain control of the state Senate. Edwards is leading Dye 50 percent to 44 percent with 83 percent of the vote counted. Independent Don Caldwell, a former Democrat, has received about 6 percent of the vote. The Roanoke-area race was one of a handful of closely watched contested contests by leaders in both major political parties, which are fighting for control of the state Senate. Edwards is one of the few Democratic elected state officials left in the western part of Virginia. 9:10 p.m. Republican Richard Black has won re-election to the Virginia state Senate, fighting off an aggressive challenge from Democrat Jill McCabe. With 80 percent of precincts reporting, Black had 53 percent of the vote, compared to 47 percent for McCabe. The district stretches through the conservative outer suburbs of Loudoun and Prince William counties. The letter prompted criticism from both human rights activists and Islamic State militants who are fighting Assad there. Sturtevant leads Gecker 50 percent to 47 percent with 99 percent of the vote counted. The Richmond-area swing seat, left vacant by retiring moderate GOP Sen. John Watkins, was the focus of heavy spending by both major political parties. Sturtevant, an attorney, was helped by a Washington-based GOP group largely backed by corporate interests. 8: 55 p.m. State Sen. Lynwood Lewis has defeated Republican challenger Richard Ottinger in state Senate contest that Democrats needed to win as they try and regain control of the upper chamber. Lewis was ahead of Ottinger 57 percent to 42 percent with 59 percent of the vote counted. Senate District 6 includes parts of Hampton Roads, a portion of the middle peninsula and all of the Eastern Shore. The race was one of a handful of closely watched contests by leaders in both major political parties, which are fighting for control of the state Senate. Democratic Del. Monty Mason was beating Republican Lara Overy with 57 percent of the vote with 88 percent of the precincts reporting Tuesday. Overy had 43 percent of the vote. Mason, a Williamsburg resident who works in fraud protection for Visa, Inc., has held the seat since 2014. Overy serves as director of development at Thomas Nelson Community College. District 93 includes Williamsburg and parts of Newport News, James City and York Counties. The district has leaned Democratic in recent elections. 8:20 p.m. Republican state Sen. Frank Wagner has defeated Democrat Gary McCollum in state Senate contest that Republicans needed to help keep control of the upper chamber. Wagner was ahead of McCollum 55 percent to 45 percent with 82 percent of the vote counted. The race was one of a handful of closely watched contested contests by leaders in both major political parties, which are fighting for control of the state Senate. 5:30 p.m. The marquee race is the state Senate race to replace retiring Democrat Charles Colgan. Democrats are hoping that Jeremy McPike can fend off Republican Hal Parrish as Democrats seek to wrest control of the Senate from the GOP. Woodbridge resident Edwin Williams-Greer and his husband, Mark Williams-Greer, voted for McPike. Mark Williams Greer said he and his husband are two black, married men and what they heard from the Republican side was not good at all. His husband said gun control was an issue for him. Woodbridge resident Frances Sarno voted for Parrish. She said she came out primarily to vote for Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart, but was also persuaded to vote for Parrish. She said it could have been the ads that persuaded her. The contest featured heavy spending on both sides. 1:30 p.m. Republican Glen Sturtevant is doing some last-minute campaigning in a heavily Democratic area of the state Senate district he hopes to represent. Sturtevant was shaking hands with a steady stream of voters outside a polling place in the Museum District on Tuesday. Brendan Workman, a mortgage consultant, said Sturtevant seems more genuine than his opponent, Democrat Dan Gecker. Gun control has become a key issue in the race, with both the NRA and a gun-control group backed by Michael Bloomberg spending heavily on advertisements. 12:40 p.m. The Democratic Party of Virginia released a memo to the news media Tuesday morning that appears aimed at tempering expectations about Election Day results. 12:30 p.m. Voters in Chesterfield County cast ballots Tuesday in a heated state Senate race that could decide partisan control of the upper chamber. Ron Davis, a retiree, cast his ballot at Clover Hill Elementary School for Democrat Dan Gecker. Shearer, also a retiree, said no candidate should be so heavily financed by out-of-state interests. Republicans control the House of Delegates by an overwhelming majority. 10:30 a.m. A steady stream of voters filed into Janke Road Baptist Church in Richmond on Tuesday morning to vote in one of the key state Senate races. Morton Mumma of Richmond voted with his wife shortly after 9 a.m. The two men are facing off in Senate District 10, with control of the state Senate in the balance. Precinct official Chante Henderson said more than 230 voters had cast ballots shortly before 10 a.m.. The precinct has about 2,500 registered voters. Republicans control the House of Delegates by an overwhelming majority. 2 a.m. The polls are open across Virginia from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. Tuesday.

In races for the 40-member Senate, the competition was only slightly less tepid. Six of the races were relatively tight, while 20 candidates faced no major-party opponent whatsoever. No wonder voter participation, which has plummeted for years when state legislative races top the ballot, fell to an all-time low on Tuesday. Back then, and until computer-assisted gerrymandering was fine-tuned in the mid-1990s, turnout generally exceeded 50 percent in legislative-only election years. Incumbents of both parties are guilty of having deployed technological wizardry to manipulate electoral maps for their own political benefit and job security. In a state as evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans as any in the nation, there are vanishingly few state legislative districts drawn in such a way as to enable genuine electoral competition. When nearly every candidate wins by acclamation or blowout, democracy becomes a sham. When incumbents never face real competition from the opposing party, they move to the ideological extremes to protect themselves from primary challenges, thus minimizing the chance of compromise in the process of actual lawmaking. Virginia, where Republicans have had the edge in Richmond, is not the only offender. Maryland, where Democrats are dominant in Annapolis, is just as guilty of running an incumbent-protection racket by means of cartographic shenanigans. In both states, Republican and Democratic governors have embraced the need for redistricting reform, meaning the creation of independent commissions that would re-draw legislative lines without regard to incumbent protection. Entrenched lawmakers in both states have arrogantly dismissed those proposals, but the governors should push ahead. By reforming in tandem, they could defuse arguments that only one party would benefit, while restoring a system in which voters can choose their representatives, rather than the reverse.

John McCain by more than 100,000 votes. Obama won the state's 13 electoral votes after he racked up huge margins in the cities and swept every jurisdiction in Northern Virginia. Virginia Republicans declined to concede early this morning that Obama had won the state, saying there were still votes to be counted, including overseas absentee ballots. But Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) told a crowd of Democrats gathered at the Hilton McLean Tysons Corner about 11 p.m. that Obama had become the first Democrat to carry the state since 1964. The crowd erupted, pumping fists, jumping and embracing, and snapping pictures with cellphones. Obama's win capped a successful night for the Democrats as Mark R. Warner easily won his Senate race, and Fairfax County Board Chairman Gerald E. Connolly was elected to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Tom Davis (R). Two other GOP members of Congress from Virginia -- Thelma Drake and Virgil H. Goode Jr. -- were in danger of losing their seats last night. The strength of the Democratic ticket this year in all parts of Virginia is the latest sign that the once-reliably conservative commonwealth has rapidly shifted away from the GOP in statewide races. As both parties gear up for the 2009 governor's race, officials will try to determine whether Democrats' recent successes are a sustained realignment that could alter Virginia politics for a generation. Attorney General Robert F. McDonnell, the likely Republican nominee for governor, said he was not worried about Virginia becoming a Democratic state, saying the presidential race was fixated on federal issues, such as the Iraq war and the economy, and a desire for change. But the dynamics of this race were so unusual. These are a set of circumstances that are not to be repeated. But Scott A. Surovell, chairman of the Fairfax County Democratic Party, said last night's results spell trouble for a Virginia Republican Party that has lost two successive governor's races, two U.S. Senate seats and control of the state Senate since 2001."}

She used to have Medicaid but lost it when she gave up custody of her children due to her depression, so she's uninsured. As a low-income worker at Taco Bell, Cox almost certainly would qualify for coverage under the Medicaid expansion plan proposed by Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe. In the Nov. 3 state legislative elections, Virginia voters like Cox will have the opportunity to express their views on Medicaid expansion. Most of the Republican candidates for House of Delegates and Senate seats oppose McAuliffe's expansion proposal, while Democrats support it. All 140 seats in both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly are up for election. Currently, Republicans control both the House and Senate. Democrats need to pick up only one Senate seat to gain effective control of that chamber, though Medicaid expansion would still face an uphill fight in the House, where the GOP holds a two-thirds majority. Some observers say the Virginia state elections not only could swing the outcome of that state's Medicaid battle but could affect expansion's national momentum. A pivotal election also will be held in Kentucky, where the Republican candidate has vowed to roll back outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear's Medicaid expansion. A new governor also will be elected in Louisiana to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, a strong expansion foe; all four leading candidates have said they would consider some form of expansion. The ballot results in these state races could send a message to GOP leaders in other states such as Florida, North Carolina, Utah and Wyoming, where expansion is being debated. Gov. Terry McAuliffe's expected 2016 push to expand Medicaid in Virginia will ride on Dems picking up just one more Senate seat. But Shana Cox had no idea there was a political fight over expanding Medicaid in her state. She just lamented that she was no longer eligible for Medicaid. The Virginia Medicaid battle is playing out in the 12th Senate District, which includes Richmond. There, Dr. Siobhan Dunnavant, an OB-GYN and a Republican, is facing off against registered nurse Deborah Repp, a Democrat. The seat they are vying for is being vacated by retiring state Sen. Walter Stosch, one of only three Senate Republicans who aligned with McAuliffe and the Democrats last year to support a private-plan Medicaid expansion proposal similar to Arkansas' model. It's expected that McAuliffe will again try to pass his plan in 2016, after failing this year. Dunnavant is firmly against expansion, while Repp is for it. The state's hospitals, which pushed hard for Medicaid expansion last year, are taking a more cautious approach now, stressing the need for some type of legislative action to ease the financial stress on hospitals from uncompensated care and Medicare payment cuts. In an interview, McAuliffe stressed the importance of Medicaid expansion. MH Takeaways Ballot results in state races in Virginia, Kentucky and Louisiana could send a message to GOP leaders in other states that are debating Medicaid expansion. But Dunnavant, like many of the GOP candidates, opposes all things Obamacare. Repp takes the opposite view. Last week, the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association launched a major multimedia campaign to highlight the key role of hospitals in the state's economy, the financial struggles its members are facing, and the need for legislative relief. The association reported that one-third of the state's acute-care hospitals had negative operating margins in 2013, the last year for which data are available. In rural Virginia, 17 of 37 hospitals operated in the red. Those cuts come on top of the Medicare disproportionate-share cuts required by the Affordable Care Act. At the hospital association's Sept. 16 news conference in Richmond, health system CEOs from around the state warned that without legislative relief from the state, cuts in services, layoffs or even closures could result. Mark Merrill, CEO of Valley Health, based in Winchester, said his organization was considering closing its trauma center in western Virginia, which means some people in the area would have to cross into West Virginia to receive trauma care. Last year, the state hospital association pressed hard for Medicaid expansion. But at the news conference, none of the hospital leaders who spoke explicitly raised the issue. one reporter asked. The hospital association's economic arguments are a smart approach politically, said Joshua Ulibarri, a partner at Lake Research Partners who is polling for the VA House Democratic Caucus and three Democratic state senators. Medicaid expansion trails behind jobs and education as an issue for voters, he said. The key Virginia races to watch are in the Senate, because it's unlikely the Democrats can win a majority in the House, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. Democrats only need to gain a single Senate seat to create a 20-20 split and throw the tie-breaking vote to Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. That scenario would put McAuliffe and the Democrats in a stronger position to push through Medicaid expansion, though it still would face a tough hurdle in the House, Farnsworth said. Republican House Speaker William J. Howell has vowed never to vote to expand Medicaid. Making McAuliffe's task even harder is that the Republican primaries eliminated some GOP candidates who might have been open to some form of Medicaid expansion. In the 24th Senate District, Sen. Emmett Hanger, who proposed Medicaid expansion through a private-plan model, had to fight hard to beat back a primary challenge. Dunnavant said she doesn't believe the Obama administration would give her state the autonomy it needs to create a uniquely Virginian approach to providing coverage to the poor. Chris LaCivita, a veteran Republican political operative who is working on the state Senate campaign of Dr. Nancy Dye, a retired Roanoke surgeon, said it's possible Congress will reduce the federal contribution. Republican state Sen. Bill Carrico in the 40th Senate District, opposes expansion even though a hospital in his district, Lee Regional Medical Center, Pennington Gap, closed last year, and residents in his southwest Virginia district have one of the state's highest uninsured rates. He argued that even his uninsured constituents oppose expansion. Back at Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg, Todd Welsh, 32, who works as a contractor and has no health insurance, says grueling hours and heavy lifting have taken a toll on his health. He suffers searing back pain that keeps him up at night. Welsh, who supports five children, said after paying household bills, he has nothing left. But like Shana Cox, he had no idea that there was a political fight over Medicaid, and expressed doubt that he'll ever get coverage. Dickson earned a bachelor's degree from DePaul University in 2007.

While some of the individual results may be important, proponents of a fair and representative democracy see little to celebrate overall in the 2015 Virginia general election results. Only 29 out of the 100 House races had a two-party contest. Of those, only six races were seen as truly competitive. Inspire Virginia is a civic engagement organization based in Arlington. Through its work, Inspire Virginia has an understanding of the frustrations identified by the Washington Post and experienced by voters. We believe that hope lies in the youth vote and that is why we support and empower high school student leaders to mobilize the youth vote. A healthy and representative democracy requires ideas, debate, and votes from every demographic. Young people offer unique attributes that could energize Virginia elections and the political process: Young people are more likely than other age groups to be unaffiliated with a specific party and want candidate interaction beyond just party identification. Studies show active young voters influence members of households to go and vote. Inspire Virginia is working to transform the way the youth vote is viewed; we must empower every eligible high school student to vote as soon as they are eligible. In August, Inspire Virginia brought together 60 students from 18 different high schools in six different counties, including Washington-Lee High School in Arlington. Inspire Virginia recruits three or four exceptional leaders in partner high schools across the state. We educate, train, and ultimately, inspire these student leaders to return to their schools and mobilize their peers to participate in the democratic process. Our mission is to inspire student leaders in each high school across the state to register every eligible student and empower those students to vote. In the weeks since the summer conference, Inspired Leaders have worked to register 172 voters, and nearly 900 of their peers have pledged to register when they become eligible. These 1,072 youth votes are just the beginning. Virginia law allows 17 year-olds to register and vote in primary elections as long as they will turn 18 by the general election. For 2016, that means many seniors can register and vote in both the March presidential primary and the June primary for Congress and other offices. Our state, by incorporating the collective youth demographic into Virginia civic life, will reinvigorate an elections process that has been criticized as stale and ineffective. This is why Inspire Virginia is working to register thousands of new, interactive voters across the state. We hope you will join us in welcoming and supporting these new additions to the electorate. For more information, visit our website. Isabel Alcalde and Alex Chandler are Program Coordinators for Inspire Virginia. Inspire Virginia is the seventh state chapter of Inspire US, a unique program dedicated to supporting students in a year-long civic experience. All Rights Reserved. Site design by Brave UX.

(December 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The government of Virginia combines the three branches of authority in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The current Governor of Virginia is Ralph Northam. The State Capitol building in Richmond was designed by Thomas Jefferson, and the cornerstone was laid by Governor Patrick Henry in 1785. Virginia currently functions under the 1971 Constitution of Virginia. It is the Commonwealth's seventh constitution. Under the Constitution, the government is composed of three branches, the legislative, the executive and the judicial. All three officers are separately elected to four-year terms in years following Presidential elections (1997, 2001, 2005, etc.) and take office in January of the following year. Virginia is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years (the others are Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Jersey). The last gubernatorial election was in 2017, and the next will occur in 2021. The governor serves as chief executive officer of the Commonwealth and as commander-in-chief of its militia. The Constitution does not allow a governor to succeed himself in office (though a governor is allowed to serve multiple non-consecutive terms). The Lieutenant Governor, who is not elected on the same ticket as the governor, serves as president of the Senate of Virginia and is first in the line of succession to the governor. The Lieutenant Governor is allowed to run for reelection. The Attorney General is chief legal advisor to the governor and the General Assembly, chief lawyer of the Commonwealth and the head of the Department of Law. The attorney general is second in the line of succession to the governor. Whenever there is a vacancy in all three executive offices of governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general, then the Speaker of the House of the Virginia House of Delegates becomes governor. Proposals to create or amend state regulations are often subject to review by the executive branch. The General Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of a lower house, the Virginia House of Delegates, with 100 members, and an upper house, the Senate of Virginia, with 40 members. Combined together, the General Assembly consists of 140 elected representatives from an equal number of constituent districts across the commonwealth. The General Assembly holds sessions in the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond. The House of Delegates is presided over by the Speaker of the House, while the Senate is presided over by the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. The House and Senate each elect a clerk and sergeant-at-arms. The General Assembly also selects the Commonwealth's Auditor of Public Accounts. The statutory law enacted by the General Assembly is codified in the Code of Virginia. Its administration is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Judicial Council, the Committee on District Courts, the Judicial Conferences, and various other officers. In Virginia, the political subdivisions have only the legal powers specifically granted to them by the General Assembly and set forth under the Code of Virginia. Some are local governments; others are not. However, all local governments (cities, counties, and incorporated towns) are political subdivisions of the state. Some political subdivisions are defined geographically; others by function. Many authorities (such as water, or transportation districts) are created by specific legislation as political subdivisions of the state. The 95 counties and the 39 independent cities all have their own governments. Virginia limits the authority of cities and counties to enact ordinances by what is known as the Dillon's Rule. There are exceptions to the general structure for counties and cities, notably the City of Richmond, which has a popularly elected mayor who serves as chief executive separate from the city council, an innovative arrangement which has caused some local turmoil under the first mayor so elected, former Governor Lawrence D. Wilder. The positions of these constitutional officers are provided for by the Virginia Constitution. The local constitutional offices are not appointed by the city or county. The Judges of the Circuit Court, the General District Court and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court are appointed by the State legislature. This structure allows those officers a measure of independence within the local government setting. The Sheriff is the law enforcement officer for localities without a police department. In colonial Virginia, the lower house of the legislature was called the House of Burgesses. The Governor's Council was composed of 12 men appointed by the British monarch to advise the governor. Members of the House of Burgesses were chosen by all those who could vote in the colony. Each county chose two people or burgesses to represent it, while the College of William and Mary and the cities of Norfolk, Williamsburg and Jamestown each chose one burgess. The Burgesses met to make laws for the colony and set the direction for its future growth; the council would then review the laws and either approve or disapprove them. The approval of the Burgesses, the council, and the governor was needed to pass a law. The idea of electing burgesses was important and new. It gave Virginians a chance to control their own government for the first time. At first, the burgesses were elected by all free men in the colony. Women, indentured servants, and Native Americans could not vote. Like many other states, by the 1850s Virginia featured a state legislature, several executive officers, and an independent judiciary. By the time of the Constitution of 1901, which lasted longer than any other state constitution, the General Assembly continued as the legislature, the Supreme Court of Appeals acted as the judiciary, and the eight executive officers were elected: the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, Secretary of the Commonwealth, state treasurer, auditor of public accounts, superintendent of public instruction, and commissioner of agriculture and immigration. The Constitution of 1901 was amended many times, notably in the 1930s and 1950s, before it was abandoned in favor of more modern government, with fewer elected officials, reformed local governments and a more streamlined judiciary.

Chris Hurst beat Yost Tuesday in a high-profile race for the Blacksburg-area seat. By Wednesday morning, Democrats had picked up 14 of the 17 seats they would need to retake the chamber for the first time in two decades. The last time Democrats picked up more than five seats was 1975, according to Toscano. This election season, with all 100 seats up for grabs, saw Democrats make their most energetic push in years to gain ground against Republicans. Sixty of the seats were contested by candidates of both major parties, more than in any year for at least two decades. The House gains were part of a stellar night for Democrats, who swept all three statewide races. Republicans maintained during the campaign that they would retain their majority. The shift in power could have far reaching policy and political implications. It will change the makeup of committees, and Republicans may no longer be able to block Medicaid expansion. Democrats in Virginia also will have greater leverage when drawing new congressional and legislative boundaries during the next redistricting. They will be eligible for recounts if candidates request them. In one race, only 12 votes separated Republican Del. David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simonds. At least nine of the new seats will be filled by women. Among those will be Danica Roem, who is transgender. Earlier this year, Marshall sponsored a bill that would have limited the bathrooms transgender people can use. She will also make history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a state legislature, according to the Victory Fund, a political action committee that works to get openly LGBTQ people elected. In the Blacksburg area, Chris Hurst, a former Virginia news anchor whose journalist girlfriend was fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015, defeated a Republican incumbent.

Day one focused on challenges facing Virginia Democrats in competitive districts, day two focused on problems with turnout. On day three, we were visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past to teach us the lessons of past campaign mistakes. I use this threshold because we saw how important it was in determining safe Democratic seats. After redistricting this was slashed down to 33 seats. Though Democrats won it in 2013, it will be a difficult district to hold until demographics catch up. But if Futrell can hang on in 2015 I think he could be set for the rest of the decade. This gets many incumbents to at least 2017, if not beyond, when another Republican gerrymandering may save them again. Ramadan won the seat by 51 votes in 2011 and then 195 votes in 2013. Not only did Democrats lose a stronger Democratic seat, they lost the voice of a non-Northern Virginia Democrat to demonstrate the regional diversity of our party. The difficulties in recruiting downstate Democrats for the House of Delegates spreads to higher offices. Wagner and McWaters could be vulnerable in Virginia Beach, but the Republican gerrymandering prevents local up and coming Democrats from getting a foothold. The number of Obama-won delegate seats dropped from 50 to 47. While many seats in Northern Virginia remained competitive, downstate saw larger changes. Virginia Beach in particular was hit hard, denying Democrats the chance of having a stronger farm team for running for higher office in the State Senate, Congress, or statewide. The 58th and 59th, two districts in Central Virginia that include portions of Albemarle, were made safely Republican. As a result, Republicans have prevented a local politician from developing a strong reputation and posing a risk to Robert Hurt in the 5th District. Democrats saw the pool of competitive seats shrink from 59 to 52 after redistricting. The net five-seat reduction in safe Democratic seats is a primary reason that the House Democrats have hit rock bottom. But fewer competitive seats downstate also reduces the farm team of good candidates for other elected offices, painting our party into a corner in Northern Virginia. Overall nonpartisan redistricting would produce small, marginal improvements over Republican gerrymandering for Democrats. The biggest impact would be a few more safe Democratic seats, and a larger playing field of potentially competitive seats, especially outside of Northern Virginia.

(J. But based on their showing in several key races in Northern Virginia, some Republicans say they may be losing the war. Even though the party retained its strong majority in the General Assembly on Nov. 3, the party lost ground in the suburbs and exurbs of Washington, the still-growing parts of the state with the most people. Those farther-out farmlands and small towns have traditionally helped Republicans mitigate the dense Democratic vote just outside Washington. Now, as new Asian and Hispanic residents move into that territory, what was reliably red is becoming more and more challenging for Republicans, some party leaders say. Republicans lost two state House seats in Loudoun and Prince William counties, two of three fastest-growing counties in the state. The third is Fairfax, where they lost a supervisor seat in the once-rural western part of the county. Three Republicans lost supervisor races in Loudoun, including veterans Eugene A. Delgaudio and Scott York (who ran as an independent). Meanwhile, two more Republican supervisors won by only a few hundred votes each. State Sen. Richard H. Black, who won by 14 percentage points in 2011, this year won by five. In one of the most hotly contested Senate races on the map, a seat held by retiring state Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D), the Democratic candidate won by eight points. Incumbent Dranesville Supervisor John W. Foust (D), targeted by Republicans and outspent, also won by eight. So did state Sen. George Barker (D-Fairfax), another Republican target outspent by his GOP rival. Republicans did pick up one House seat that straddles Prince William and more rural Stafford counties, winning by 158 votes a race where they outspent Democrats by a 3-to-1 margin. In the Prince William portion of the district, Republican L. Mark Dudenhefer lost by 30 points. Outspent and hit with a last-minute barrage of negative ads focused on tolls, Del. Kathleen Murphy (D) still narrowly beat Republican Craig Parisot. Her district straddles Loudoun and Fairfax, but she beat Parisot even in the Loudoun portion of the district. Jennifer Boysko, likewise, beat Republican Danny Vargas for an open seat in Loudoun and Prince William. She, too, edged out her opponent in Loudoun. Three of their House candidates in Northern Virginia this year were minorities, and all three lost. Infighting and scandal in Loudoun created a three-way race between York, the Republican nominee and Democratic victor Phyllis Randall. In 2016, funding is far more likely to be evenly matched. But Democrats can also build on the investment they made this year in data and field operations. State GOP Chairman John Whitbeck dismisses those concerns, saying that the Election Day results reveal nothing new. Retirements of popular incumbents cost Republicans some territory, he argued, not any new shift in demographics. At the same time, he said Republicans were well aware that those shifts were happening. Republicans point to Ed Gillespie, who nearly defeated Sen. Mark R. Warner (D) in 2014, as a sign of how the party can succeed in Northern Virginia. A Republican clerk of the court held on in Fairfax. While the attacks stemming from a plan to charge single drivers a high fee to join carpoolers on a Fairfax parkway did not succeed, Republicans point out that Democrats abandoned McAuliffe on the issue. Gillespie edged out Warner in Loudoun but lost in Northern Virginia and in the state thanks to Arlington and Fairfax. But that same year, Republican Barbara Comstock outperformed him in Loudoun in her own race for Congress, beating her Democratic opponent there by 11 points. She won the Fairfax portion of her district by about the same margin.

Currently Republicans hold 51 seats while Democrats hold 49, but several of those races were squeakers. In preliminary hearings this week, judges set dates for three of the four races heading to recount, according to spokesmen for both House Republicans and House Democrats. The first recount will be Dec. 13 and 14 in Fairfax and Prince William counties for the 40th District, where incumbent Del. Tim Hugo (R) narrowly won reelection by a 106-vote margin over Democrat Donte Tanner. The closest race heading to recount is the 94th District in Newport News, where Del. David E. Yancey (R) beat Shelly Simonds by 10 votes. That recount will be held Dec. 19. G. Manoli Loupassi (R-Richmond), who lost to Democrat Dawn Adams by 336 votes. A preliminary hearing that would determine the date for a recount in the 28th District has not yet been held. In that race, Republican Bob Thomas leads Democrat Joshua Cole by 82 votes in the contest to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). More than 100 voters in the 28th District and neighboring 88th District were given the wrong ballots, state elections officials say. In the 88th District, Del. No one is questioning the outcome of that race, even with the misassigned ballots, because the margin was so wide. Democrats and Republicans both say they expect the recount for the 28th District will be held Dec. 21. On Nov. 7, Virginians voted with paper ballots scanned by electronic machines. Recounts consider ballots that were deemed illegible, but where the voter intent may be clear, even if they did not follow the proper instructions for marking their choice. The state pays for recounts in races where the candidates are separated by less than half of a percentage point. The Loupassi-Adams race did not fall within that margin, and Loupassi must bear the costs. If Adams prevails in a recount and Democrats flip two of the other Republican-held seats after a recount, Democrats will take control of the chamber for the first time since 2000. If Adams prevails and Democrats pick up one seat, the chamber will be split 50-50 with no tiebreaking mechanism and the parties must negotiate a power-sharing agreement. Gov-elect.

Last year the General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill to support solar development, and then failed to fund it.

Two times the number of Democrats contested GOP statehouse seats this time as opposed to 2013. Of the 16 seats captured by Democrats as of press time, 12 were won by women. The grassroots victories across the state were so large that it could reasonably be argued that a reverse coattails effect had taken place with the top of the ticket actually benefitting from excitement and voting that took place on the ground. Progressives have Trumpites running scared because all over this state they ran on platforms rejecting the Trump agenda and calling for things like universal healthcare, free college education, higher wages, and massive job creation programs. Unity was an important factor, too. Progressives initially backed a different gubernatorial candidate in the primary but got on board in the general election to support the more moderate Ralph Northam. Labor and progressive activists went into this election with some trepidation. Although the Democrats now control all three state executive offices, turnout in Virginia is usually low in years when there is no federal election, and Republicans, who controlled the legislature, have been working hard at various methods of tamping down the Democratic vote, including legislative district gerrymandering and vote suppression. But when the dust cleared on Tuesday, it was evident that the Democrats had triumphed and the Republicans had to limp away bleeding in an election that all sides see as having major national implications. The current Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, is popular, but the Virginia constitution does not allow him to succeed himself. In the June 13 primary, centrist Ralph Northam beat ex Congressman Tom Perriello, who had been supported by more left-leaning Democrats of the Bernie Sanders orientation. Although all sectors of the Virginia Democratic Party, including Perriello, came together to support Northam, there was nevertheless worry about his candidacy. He was seen as a lackluster campaigner and public speaker, and a couple of controversies created great moments of worry. The reason was that Fairfax has opposed plans for a pipeline that the union wants to see built because of job creation hopes. But in an election in which the turnout of African Americans was seen as being absolutely crucial, many saw removing the only African-American statewide candidate from the literature as a clumsy move. At the end of the campaign, Northam made a statement that he would support a ban on sanctuary cities in Virginia. Before him, Douglas Wilder served as governor from 1990 to 1994. And incumbent Attorney General Mark Herring, who had sued the Trump administration because of its travel ban and cutbacks on health care, beat Adams by a majority of 53.3 to 46.7 percent. All this was very gratifying to the Democrats and their supporters, but the biggest surprise to many was that the Democrats racked up huge wins in the House of Delegates, without losing a single seat of their own. The grassroots activists who were responsible for the victories, however, were far less surprised. As of press time, five seats of the 100 remain too close to call, with Democrats ahead in two of them and Republicans in three. But Democratic wins are confirmed in 48 seats, up from the current 34, while the Republicans have won only 47, down from 66. The Democrats who won include a slew of candidates supported by progressive grassroots groups such as the Bernie Sanders-linked outfit, Our Revolution. Two Latina women were elected, the first in the Virginia legislature: Hala Ayala (53-47 percent) and Elizabeth Guzman (54 to 45 percent). An Asian-American woman, Kathy Tran, also in Northern Virginia, won by 62 to 38 percent. Another African-American woman, Jennifer Carroll Foy, was elected by 63 to 37 percent in the Second Delegate district in Northern Virginia, where this writer lives and votes. For the first time ever, a transgender woman, Danica Roem, won a Virginia delegate seat, defeating Republican incumbent Rob Marshall, one of the worst gay-baiters in Virginia politics. Her campaign placed a heavy emphasis on rebuilding infrastructure, particularly highways running through her district. And in yet another Northern Virginia district, an openly declared socialist, Lee Carter, a 30- year old ex-Marine who belongs to Democratic Socialists of America, handily beat the Republican Whip of the House of Delegates, Jackson Miller, 54 to 46 percent. They feared losses due to low turnout. For example, the last state House election in 2015 saw a turnout rate of only 29 percent of registered voters, which left in its wake a House of Delegates with a huge Republican majority of 66 to 34. The worries for 2017 turned out to be unfounded. Turnout appears to have been particularly high in areas with large minority group, especially African American, populations. This happened in spite of various vote suppression efforts by the Republicans, and, in heavily Democratic Northern Virginia, a cold rain that began to fall in the afternoon. The Democrats triumphed in Northern Virginia, in Richmond (the state capital), in areas with large African-American populations such as Danville and the Tidewater region, and in medium-sized cities, especially college towns. For Virginia residents, these election results mean that perhaps key issues of concern such as improving health care for low income people may now be out of the deep freeze. Anti-immigrant, anti-woman, anti-LGBTQ, and environmentally destructive legislation will be far less likely to advance, and more likely to be vetoed if somehow it passes. This will have repercussions in both Virginia and the nation. There is an election for the federal Senate seat currently held by Tim Kaine, D-Va., next year. But Prince William County itself went heavily Democratic (61 percent Northam, 38 percent Gillespie) on Tuesday (as did Charlottesville, by a margin of 85 percent for Northam and 14 percent for Gillespie). The next county elections in Prince William are in 2019, and work is already underway to oust Stewart. Finally, the big lesson is that grassroots organizing is key. The candidates supported by progressive grassroots organizations, including Our Revolution, played a major role in getting out the vote. Maybe this will inspire emulation nationally in 2018.

In the days leading up to Election Day, both parties and their out-of-state surrogates have spent record amounts in advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. McPike, 40, a volunteer firefighter from Dale City who is director of general services for the city of Alexandria, is fighting to hold onto the seat occupied since 1976 by Sen. Charles J. Colgan, D-Prince William, who is retiring. The race is one of two in swing districts considered the closest and most crucial to controlling the chamber. The other close race is in the 10th District, where Gecker, a businessman and member of the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, is battling with Republican Glen H. Sturtevant, a lawyer and Richmond School Board member, to succeed retiring Sen. John Watkins, R-Powhatan. The contest also features independent Marleen K. Durfee and Libertarian Carl R. Loser. Both parties also are taking on incumbents in races that are considered longer shots. Republicans are challenging Democrats in Roanoke, where retired surgeon Nancy Dye is taking on Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke, in the 21st District seat he has held since 1996. Republican Richard Ottinger is making a play for the 6th District seat held by Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr., D-Accomack. In January 2014, Lewis won a special election to succeed Northam by 11 votes. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to unseat GOP incumbents in Virginia Beach and Loudoun. In District 13, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician, is challenging Sen. Richard H. Black, R-Loudoun, a lawyer and former state delegate who has held the seat since 2012. In District 7, Gary McCollum, a former Cox Communications executive, is trying to unseat Sen. Frank W. Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, the former owner of a ship repair company who has held the seat since 2001. McAuliffe, along with U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, a former Virginia governor, is scheduled to make stops today on behalf of Edwards, McCabe, McPike, Lewis, McCollum and Gecker. Only 38 of the 100 House of Delegates seats have more than one candidate, and nine of those contests have only independent or third-party challengers to a Democrat or Republican. All but 11 incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Only 22 of 40 Virginia Senate races have more than one candidate, with two of the 22 featuring only an independent or third-party challenge to a sitting incumbent. All but seven incumbents are running for re-election, the majority of them unopposed. Kidd said turnout in elections in which General Assembly contests lead the ballot has steadily declined over the past three decades, driven by gerrymandered districts that provide little or no competition to incumbents. Turnout dipped from 51 percent in 1983 to 29 percent in 2011. A recent Wason Center survey predicts turnout of between 23 and 29 percent on Tuesday. He said Republicans have the advantage going into this off-year cycle because they hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature. Given the scarcity of competition, money has poured into the few races where both parties are running robust campaigns. In addition to the Parrish-McPike race, two other Senate contests are on pace to break money records. Everytown is backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose name has been frequently invoked by the Republicans who Everytown is going up against. Kidd was less sure about whether the avalanche of political advertising in the two most closely watched races, to succeed Watkins in the 10th and Colgan in the 29th, would change the outcome. In Chesterfield, Republican Amanda Chase, who defeated 21-year incumbent Stephen H. Martin, R-Chesterfield, in a June primary, is running in a GOP-tilted 11th District race against Democrat Wayne Powell. Dye is challenging Edwards, and McCabe is challenging Black in races that are competitive but expected to lean toward the incumbents. Regardless of the outcome Tuesday, major changes on major issues are unlikely to result. getRecommendations. audiences or keywords to work with."}

He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan.

He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said.

Even in those races, most were contests in name only, with an average victory margin of nearly 20 percentage points. All 100 seats in the House were on the ballot, but just 29 of them featured a Republican pitted against a Democrat; of those contests, just six resulted in competitive races, meaning a victory margin of less than 10 percentage points. In races for the 40-member Senate, the competition was only slightly less tepid. Six of the races were relatively tight, while 20 candidates faced no major-party opponent whatsoever. No wonder voter participation, which has plummeted for years when state legislative races top the ballot, fell to an all-time low on Tuesday. Back then, and until computer-assisted gerrymandering was fine-tuned in the mid-1990s, turnout generally exceeded 50 percent in legislative-only election years. Incumbents of both parties are guilty of having deployed technological wizardry to manipulate electoral maps for their own political benefit and job security. In a state as evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans as any in the nation, there are vanishingly few state legislative districts drawn in such a way as to enable genuine electoral competition. When nearly every candidate wins by acclamation or blowout, democracy becomes a sham. When incumbents never face real competition from the opposing party, they move to the ideological extremes to protect themselves from primary challenges, thus minimizing the chance of compromise in the process of actual lawmaking. Virginia, where Republicans have had the edge in Richmond, is not the only offender. Maryland, where Democrats are dominant in Annapolis, is just as guilty of running an incumbent-protection racket by means of cartographic shenanigans. In both states, Republican and Democratic governors have embraced the need for redistricting reform, meaning the creation of independent commissions that would re-draw legislative lines without regard to incumbent protection. Entrenched lawmakers in both states have arrogantly dismissed those proposals, but the governors should push ahead. By reforming in tandem, they could defuse arguments that only one party would benefit, while restoring a system in which voters can choose their representatives, rather than the reverse.

If they change the outcome in one race, the two parties must negotiate a power-sharing agreement. The losing Democrats in all three disputed races have been attending orientation sessions for new lawmakers in the event they eventually win. A spokesman for Del. M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights), who is set to be speaker if Republicans stay in the majority, said the requests for recounts were expected. After candidates petition for a recount, a judge has seven days to hold a preliminary hearing. Recounts are overseen by a panel including the chief judge of the local circuit court and two judges appointed by the chief justice of the Virginia Supreme Court. Under Virginia state law, taxpayers pay for the cost of recounts for races where the winning margin is smaller than half of a percentage point. Campaigns still bear the costs of legal fees.

He bested Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway. By evening's end, Republicans were the ones crowing, as they scored a surprise win in a hotly contested governor's race in Kentucky while keeping control of the state Senate in Virginia, despite a big spending onslaught from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group. By contrast, Democrats were a little on the quiet side. A stinging defeat in Houston, where voters rolled back an ordinance that had expanded nondiscrimination protections to LGBT people, illustrated the risks attached to ballot initiative tactics that the party has increasingly used as a means of advancing its policy goals when blocked by the GOP. Bevin, who has promised to dismantle the state's successful Obamacare exchange, will now have that opportunity. Not quite. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act believe that Republicans could face a backlash if Bevin goes ahead with his pledge. In fact, toward the end of the campaign, Bevin had already begun to soften his rhetoric against the state's Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. But Republican consultant Liz Mair sees the wealthy businessman's win as the latest sign that any attachment to the controversial program -- which the Democrat candidate had planned to preserve -- is still poison at the polls. Virginia's mixed bag The commonwealth has been caught between a Democratic governor, Clinton pal Terry McAuliffe, and a heavily Republican state House of Representatives. But its state Senate entered Tuesday very much up for grabs. In the end though, the GOP retained its advantage -- and its ability to handcuff the Democratic administration from pursuing its legislative agenda. That includes a push for stricter gun-control laws, which have become a staple of Hillary Clinton's pitch to more liberal Democratic primary voters. Reading into the referenda results If Republicans won the most notable contest of the off-year 2015 Election Day in Kentucky, Democrats scored a number of lower-profile but potentially significant victories through ballot initiatives. Democrats and supporters of campaign finance reform won hard fought and expensive battles in Seattle and Maine, where voters boosted initiatives to amp up public financing of elections. But with Tuesday's vote, she said, the sale became a whole lot easier for more liberal candidates like Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The elections weren't about 2016 Even as Republicans dole out the virtual backslaps to Bevin in Kentucky and point to the results in Virginia as proof gun control advocacy is a dead end for Clinton, Election Day 2015 may not provide much of a crystal ball at what's to come over the next 12 months.

Two exceptions to this rule are Republicans Glen Sturtevant (in the 10th State Senate district) and Hal Parrish (in the 29th State Senate district), both of whom have active YouTube channels and significant number (e.g., over 10k) video views. Other than that, we might as well be in the pre-YouTube era back in 2005, because basically none of the other State Senate and House of Delegates campaigns I looked at are using that social media tool. Another key State Senate race is in the 10th district, where Glen Sturtevant (mentioned above) is facing Democratic nominee Dan Gecker. When it comes to Twitter, Sturtevant has a huge lead on Gecker, who inexplicably waited until August 27 to even open a Twitter account.

John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) has occupied since 1996, could determine which party controls the Senate and whether Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has sway with the legislature in the remaining two years of his term. It also will show whether Democrats in this key presidential swing state can maintain a foothold in the region. Even some Democrats who think Edwards is safe say the district has grown more challenging. Republicans are trying to knock off Edwards, a former Marine and U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, with Nancy Dye, a businesswoman, civic leader and retired surgeon. His bid is widely considered a long shot, but he could play the role of spoiler in a tight race. All 140 legislative seats are up for grabs in November, but with the House of Delegates firmly in Republican control, most of the attention is on the Senate, where Republicans enjoy a 21-19 majority. Democrats have to hold onto all of their seats and pick up one more to make it a tie and take control. Democrats would be in charge of a 20-20 Senate, because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) presides over the chamber and has the power to break most ties. Four of the six senators elected to represent the Southwest that year were on his side of the aisle. He is one of just two west of Charlottesville, the other being Sen. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath). All gun rights supporters, they spoke on broad themes without drawing sharp policy distinctions. Edwards touted his long tenure in Richmond. Dye highlighted her experience outside of politics. Caldwell said he would have leverage as an independent in a closely divided Senate, parlaying his crucial swing vote into gains for the region. The 21st Senate District was drawn with a pronounced hook, which makes it resemble an inverted Cape Cod and allows it to take in the deep-blue city of Roanoke and the area around Virginia Tech. Thanks to the city and Tech votes, the district has remained reliably Democratic even as other parts of it have grown redder like the rest of Southwest Virginia. When Warner narrowly won reelection to the U.S. Senate last year, it was no thanks to most of the Southwest, which rejected the former governor by double-digit margins. Democrats have been losing support in the rural South since the 1960s, but what had been a long, slow slide seemed to reach a tipping point around 2010, leaving the party with little or no sway in those regions, said Virginia Tech political science assistant professor Jason P. Kelly. He noted that Democrat Rick Boucher, who had represented Southwest Virginia in Congress since 1983, lost his seat that year to Morgan Griffith (R). The trend coincides with the rise of the tea party, but Kelly said they had not yet delved into what is driving it. Edwards easily won his most recent election, in 2011, beating well-funded Republican Dave Nutter with 56 percent of the vote. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) looks at those results and sees an easy win for Edwards.

David Yancey but that the voter had made another mark to strike out Simonds's name. Officials presiding over the five-hour recount on Tuesday had discarded that ballot en route to a historic reversal of the original election outcome. Yancey had emerged from Election Day with a 10-vote lead in the 94th District, but the recount uncovered enough additional ballots for Simonds to give her a one-vote victory. That seemed to set up the House for a rare 50-50 split between Republicans and Democrats, ending 17 years of GOP dominance and making headlines nationwide. But Republicans challenged that decision in court Wednesday, saying the voter had selected every other Republican on the ballot and intended to vote for Yancey. This is the ballot that was scrutinized in the race for the Virginia House of Delegates 94th District in Newport News, Va. The balance of power in the House stands at 50-49 in favor of Republicans until the Newport News race can be resolved. James Alcorn, chairman of the State Board of Elections, said the winner will be chosen by placing names on slips of paper into two film canisters and then drawing the canisters from a glass bowl (or his bowler hat). The drawing has been scheduled for Dec. 27 11 a.m. at the elections board in Richmond. Complicating the tiebreaking vote is the need to ensure that both a Democratic and Republican representative of the three-member elections board will be available during the holidays. But it doesn't end there. If the loser of the coin toss is unhappy with that result, he or she can seek a second recount. The turnaround shocked Democrats, who on social media were still celebrating their unlikely rise to power in the House of Delegates. Before the Nov. 7 elections, Republicans outnumbered Democrats in that chamber by 66 to 34. The GOP has a smaller, 21-to-19 edge in the state Senate, where ties votes can be broken by a Democratic lieutenant governor. With Democrat Ralph Northam set to take over as governor on Jan. 13, the party is primed to flex its newfound muscle. But the Newport News outcome now leaves things unclear. Kenneth Mallory, a paid election official chosen by the Yancey team, had spotted the ballot about halfway through the Tuesday recount. The ballot was tossed aside as invalid, the precinct was wrapped up and the recount moved on. At the end of the day, Republican and Democratic officials alike stated that they were satisfied with the process and outcome. State law limits the ability of observers to communicate with election officials during the recount, but afterward, Alvarado sounded the alarm with Yancey's legal team, according to Republican lawyer Trevor Stanley. Stanley reached out to Mallory Tuesday evening, but Mallory declined to talk until he got assurances from the city's Electoral Board that he was allowed to do so, the lawyer said. Mallory, meanwhile, said he had been agonizing about his failure to act during the recount. A middle school civics teacher, Mallory, 33, said in an interview that he had wanted to take part in the recount so he could talk about it with his students. Finally, about 10 p.m. Tuesday, Yancey's team talked with Mallory and heard his concerns. They urged him to write out his thoughts and sign them so they could take them to court in the morning, when the judges would convene to certify the results. Once the judges read the letter and heard arguments from the lawyers, they spent two hours studying the ballot in question before ruling. GOP leaders in the House of Delegates, who on Tuesday had conceded the recount and pledged to share power with Democrats in what they believed would be a chamber split 50 to 50, issued a new statement after Wednesday's turn of events. It is not clear whether a final decision in the Simonds-Yancey matchup will settle control of the House of Delegates. Election officials on Wednesday evening were finishing a recount in the 68th House District in Richmond, where Republican Del. G. Manoli Loupassi trailed Democratic challenger Dawn Adams by 336 votes, but the outcome appeared unlikely to change. And a recount is set for Thursday in Fredericksburg's District 28, where the Republican leads by 82 votes. Democrats have also challenged that race in federal court, where they are seeking a new election because more than 100 voters were mistakenly given ballots for the wrong legislative district. House Democrats were meeting in Richmond on Wednesday night to elect their own leadership for the coming General Assembly session, which starts Jan. 10. They were set to vote on their designee for speaker but held off in light of the uncertainty in the Simonds-Yancey race and in District 28. Otherwise they reelected their current caucus leadership. House Minority Leader David J. Toscano (Charlottesville) is vying with his party's longest-serving member, Del. Kenneth R. Plum (Fairfax), for the speaker position. After the court's ruling threw the balance of power back toward Republicans, Plum said he thinks Democrats need to be realistic about what's ahead. Comments The story must be told.

Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William) and John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan) have announced that they will not seek reelection next year. Now they are a rare breed. The increasingly partisan nature of the Senate is part of why Watkins announced last month that he will not run again. That is not so much the case for Colgan, 88, who has been trying to retire for three election cycles, only to have fellow Democrats talk him into staying each time. Both men are known to value problem-solving over politics and to buck their parties on occasion. While most Republicans opposed expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Watkins created a compromise plan, although it ultimately failed. When a standoff over Medicaid threatened to shut down state government last summer, Colgan joined Republicans in calling lawmakers back into session to pass a budget. The lawmakers come from districts where party loyalties have shifted since they first took office, surviving by dint of their personal popularity and moderate reputations.

More recently, many of the Senate moderates have left, and control of the chamber has switched back and forth between Republicans and Democrats. And upon taking power, both parties started playing hardball, revamping committees and redrawing district lines to take maximum advantage. Protracted ideological battles have become more common within the chamber, with Colgan and Watkins sometimes bucking their parties to try to resolve the fights. A World War II pilot who founded the regional air carrier Colgan Air, Colgan joined the Senate in 1976. A Catholic, he has usually sided with the GOP on abortion issues. Colgan said he wanted to avert a potential government shutdown. Watkins, 67, is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who has represented his suburban Richmond district in the Senate since 1998. He served in the House for 16 years before that. He has opposed Medicaid-funded abortions except in cases of rape, incest, gross fetal abnormalities or when the life of the mother is at risk. But he sided with Democrats against a highly controversial 2012 bill that, before it was amended, would have required most women to undergo a vaginal ultrasound before an abortion. Further bucking Republicans, he also opposed the amended version that wound up mandating a medically useless test. The plan had just three Republican takers in the Senate and died in the House. It upset some Democrats, who counted him as an ally in the Medicaid fight. Watkins put the blame on both parties. he said. Comments The story must be told.

In 1948, the great American political scientist V.O. Virginia now has something resembling a two-party democracy. But the system of odd-year elections for state offices distorts turnout, particularly in the growing minority population in Northern Virginia. Looking back, there are now two completely different gubernatorial races to compare to the last two presidential elections. There were vastly different campaigns in 2009 and 2013, waged by two very different candidates. We can explain an area (like Southwest Virginia) where Deeds did better but McAuliffe did worse. On election night in 2013, some may remember that votes were coming in much weaker than expected for the Democrats in Danville and a few other Southside areas. Although at first this gave reason to worry, it instead ended the night as a localized phenomenon explained by difficulties in voter turnout in the poorer, more African-American precincts of Southside Virginia. Another seat to look at is the 2nd, where Futrell was elected by just 223 votes. Deeds did not do as poorly in Danville and Southside, probably because he was running better with Southside whites and able to compensate for lower black turnout. Another cluster is in the exurbs of Stafford and Spotsylvania: 54th (Orrock), 88th (Cole), and 28th (Howell), and the neighboring 30th (Scott) in Culpeper and Orange. Finally, a red flag in this special election season, the 100th left vacant by soon-to-be State Senator Lewis. In both gubernatorial elections, Deeds and McAuliffe underperformed on the Eastern Shore. Elsewhere, the 2nd will be a tough seat to hold in 2015. And with lower turnout, the ever-elusive quest to defeat Bob Marshall may be better for 2017 than 2015. Between the Republican gerrymander, odd-year elections, and problems connecting with swing voters in competitive districts, Virginia Democrats may wish they had gotten a lump of coal for Christmas instead. Well, there are some areas where local, Virginia Democrats do better than expected, even if they are as different as Deeds and McAuliffe. But these districts are so overwhelmingly Republican that minor improvement is meaningless. These are among the safest seats out there for Democrats.

After both Republicans and Democrats spent millions of dollars, not a single seat flipped control in the upper chamber on Election Day Tuesday. The GOP retained a 21-19 lead. Republicans were helped by the Republican State Leadership Committee, a Washington-based GOP group largely backed by corporate interests that invested heavily in key races. In a closely watched Richmond-area open seat, Republican Glen Sturtevant narrowly defeated Democrat Dan Gecker to hold a seat currently held by retiring GOP Sen. John Watkins. Sturtevant beat Gecker 50 percent to 47 percent with 100 percent of the vote counted. In the House, the GOP maintained a clear advantage. With Republicans maintaining control of the General Assembly, McAuliffe lost a chance to gain leverage when negotiating with GOP lawmakers on matters like the state budget during the last two years of his term. And his top legislative priorities, like expanding Medicaid coverage or passing tighter gun laws, remain out of reach. The governor has often touted his heavy investment in data-driven voter identification and get-out-the-vote efforts that could be used to strengthen Democratic efforts in future contests. Virginia is expected to be a key swing state, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, a close friend of McAuliffe, is the favorite to be the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential contest. McAuliffe was able to tap his rolodex of wealthy donors from his days as a prominent national Democratic fundraiser with close ties to Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Bloomberg-backed candidates went one for two in Virginia, with Gecker losing and Democrat Jeremy McPike winning another closely watched and hard-fought race in northern Virginia.

The race was seen as long shot a few months ago, but the special election win in Pennsylvania, and a close race in Arizona, could give the Democrats another chance to flip a House seat before November.

Whoever emerges from the primary will take on Manchin, another vulnerable Democratic incumbent. Three Republican-held seats will be important to watch in North Carolina: Reps.

Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern covers courts and the law for Slate. John Adams, meet Virginia. On Tuesday, the people made their thoughts and feelings abundantly clear. Democrats rode an electoral wave to a legislative impasse. Blame partisan gerrymandering. Those districts were designed to entrench Republicans in power. Data and history suggest Barro and Bonier are badly mistaken. Democrats walloped Republicans at the polls, but the GOP gerrymander served as a red firewall, preventing the Democratic Party from translating its victory into an advantage in the General Assembly. It worked exactly as intended. Wisconsin Republicans engaged in a careful partisan gerrymander in 2010, identifying and sorting voters by political affiliation. In 2012, Democrats competed heavily in Wisconsin, driving up turnout with a strong ground game. President Barack Obama carried the state over Mitt Romney by nearly 7 points. Across Wisconsin, Republican state legislators received 48.6 percent of the vote yet won 60 of 99 seats in the state assembly. Thanks to its gerrymander, the GOP had preserved a sizable legislative majority with the support of a minority of voters. Democrats won at politics. They won at the polls. Advertisement Gerrymandering apologists often dismiss this problem by blaming Democratic voters for clustering together in cities, creating a few dense liberal districts but allowing the rest of the state to fall into Republican hands. There are two problems with this theory. Second, the Constitution requires that legislative districts within a state be of roughly equal population. Cities are easy to gerrymander; partisan mapmakers can carve them up into warped districts that include a sliver of the city itself and a huge chunk of the surrounding region. Listen to the Political Gabfest. Republicans played this game in Northern Virginia, too, though perhaps not quite as well as they could have. They then parceled out remaining Democrats in Republican-friendly districts. Had the maps been drawn equitably, more Democratic candidates would have prevailed. Top Comment Maybe Republicans will be more friendly to restoring voting rights to felons once members of this administration join their ranks. Jordan Ellenberg, a math professor at the University of Wisconsin and Slate contributor, told me via email that this framing misunderstands how gerrymanders work. Virginia Republicans did collapse at the polls, but they still may not cede their legislative majority to Democrats. On Tuesday, their map stood strong when faced with a liberal landslide. But until then, Democrats may languish just short of a legislative majority. The Virginia rout certainly serves as an important reminder that Democrats can still compete in individual gerrymandered districts. So we need your help. All rights reserved. example."}

The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda. All 140 seats in the General Assembly were on the ballot. Democrats could have taken control by picking up just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). But Republicans held all of their seats. View Graphic See the full results for statewide and local races. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), meanwhile, held out hope that the results could change. He said he suspected irregularities in a Richmond-area race won by the GOP because Republican turnout was so heavy. As of late Tuesday night, Democrat Dan Gecker had not conceded to his opponent, Glen Sturtevant. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a record tax hike in 2004. But Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. McAuliffe faces a more conservative Senate Republican caucus and a House with a wide GOP majority. McAuliffe, once a record-smashing fundraiser for his close friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, had hoped a win would help sway purple Virginia in 2016. National donors and outside groups on the left and right seized on the state Senate races. Republicans and Democrats alike went into Tuesday predicting success. The party sent out a two-page memo to reporters laying out reasons why this might not be its year. It noted that Republicans tend to vote in off-year elections such as this one, that Democrats are playing in traditionally Republican districts and that money has flowed in from outside groups. Fatigue from a seventh year of the Obama White House hurts even more, Democrats said. McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, favors Medicaid expansion, gun control and abortion rights. Democrats conceded that unseating Black would be as difficult as their quest to oust incumbent Republican Frank W. Wagner in Virginia Beach. Wagner withstood a challenge from Democrat Gary McCollum. Wagner, the former owner of a ship repair company, seemed vulnerable after reports that he took gifts from special interests and sponsored legislation friendly to Dominion Virginia Power. But McCollum was stung by revelations that he misrepresented his military record. Nearby, Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack) successfully defended a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger was Republican Richard H. Ottinger. In southwest Virginia, Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) prevailed in a three-way race against Republican Nancy Dye and Democrat-turned-independent Don Caldwell. Along with gun control, highway tolls came to dominate races in Northern Virginia late in the campaign. Democratic candidates said they opposed it as well, but the GOP contended that they could not be trusted to buck a governor of their own party once in office. They used the attacks against Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) and Democratic state delegate candidates John Bell and Jennifer Boysko. Meanwhile in the House of Delegates, in preliminary returns, Republicans appeared to narrowly lose their veto-proof majority, but they still maintained a huge advantage over Democrats in the polarized chamber. House Democrats picked up two seats in districts formerly held by Republicans who did not seek reelection. Boysko defeated businessman Danny Vargas (R) for Del. Bell defeated Republican Chuong Nguyen for the seat held by David I. Ramadan (R-Loudoun). Late Tuesday, Murphy was embroiled in a tight race with Craig Parisot, the Republican she narrowly defeated in a special election last year. This time around, less than 200 votes separated the candidates, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Fairfax County officials said that they will recheck the totals for Murphy and Parisot on Wednesday to see whether a recount is warranted. Late Tuesday, Republican Mark Dudenhefer was leading Democrat Josh King to take back the seat he held for one term before losing it to Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William).

{"URL_s":"https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/virginia-legislature-wages-battle-for-medicaid-expansion","Timestamp_s":"20180819002510","Sentences_t":"From a huge Republican majority (66 Republicans and 34 Democrats), the body ended up being almost, but not quite, tied. So the fight to end gerrymandering will be a continued priority for Virginia labor, progressives and the Democrats themselves. They are looking at ending the Republican majority in the Virginia Senate and also the House in 2019, when both houses are up for election. This year, it is hoped that the Republicans can be ousted from at least one of the seven federal House seats they currently hold. This massive change was effectuated by greatly increased voter turnout since the last election to the House of Delegates. This bucks the trend for low turnout in years when there is no federal election. At least in some Virginia districts, this was achieved by more effective mobilization by grassroots activists. In Northern Virginia, for example (where this writer lives) the mobilization brought in an increased representation of women and minorities, with many younger candidates elected. This has helped to inspire efforts to pass progressive legislation that had no chance before. But in spite of their paper thin majority, the Republicans, who still control the committee structures, have managed to kill the majority of bills that the Democrats have presented this year. A small amount of progress was made on the definition of felony theft. This is one of the lowest thresholds for defining felony theft in the country. The state legislature still has to approve any changes to such monuments, since the legislation was killed in the senate. Very little progress was made on legislative redistricting. But some progress has been achieved is that of Medicaid expansion. This has been a central goal for the Democrats and for labor and progressive groups in Virginia for several years. Proponents of the change point out that at any rate, state and local governments end up paying a lot for providing health care to the very poor, and Medicaid expansion would free up state funds for other crucial needs such as schools and infrastructure. So even in fiscal terms, this would be a net gain for Virginia. However, there is ideological and political opposition. The ideological right sees it as a giveaway to the undeserving poor. Opponents of the idea have spread false information that it would bankrupt the state, even though the state treasury would be a massive net winner. But in some Republican-held districts, poor working class people, including whites who voted for Trump in 2016, are in severe trouble over the issue of health care costs. So supporters of Medicaid expansion have seen a chance to win enough Republican votes to get a bill passed in the House and Senate. Work requirements like this are wrong on principle for those who believe that health care is a human right. Furthermore, such things are intended to undercut the position of labor and the working class. A worker who is on Medicaid may have to think twice about quitting her job, protesting pay and working conditions or going on strike when such requirements exist, because doing so may mean loss not only of pay but of access to health care also. However, in the Senate, a parallel bill was not passed. The problem with Medicaid expansion was that the Senate had already passed a budget in which funds for Medicare expansion were not included. So this is being fought over in the crossover period, which is supposed to be over by Saturday March 10 (although it would not be impossible to extend that deadline). Various kinds of maneuvers are being tried by the Democrats, and by Democratic governor Ralph Norham who supports the legislation. The Senate is presided over by Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who cannot vote on budgetary legislation but can introduce amendments. On March 1, a lively demonstration was held in front of the Virginia Capitol Building in downtown Richmond, demanding that Medicare expansion be authorized by the Senate. Scores of different organizations participated, as did Gov. Northam, Lt. Gov. Fairfax, Virginia Atty. Gen. Mark Herring and other political leaders. After the rally, participants went into the Capitol to lobby their legislators. At writing, the outcome is not yet known. One thing is certain: If Medicaid expansion is not passed this year, it will remain a hot button issue for the future.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Bill Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Both candidates emphasize kitchen-table issues such as economic development and education. But sharp ideological differences were on display last week as they appeared at a candidate forum. Sturtevant emphasized the need to reduce tax and regulatory burdens on businesses. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

Voatz is one of several companies exploring mobile balloting and recording votes on the blockchain. So far the technology has been limited to trial runs and private elections, such as balloting for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. West Virginia will limit the use of Voatz largely to troops serving abroad. Officials tested Voatz in two counties during the primary election earlier this year with financial backing from Tusk Montgomery Philanthropies.

Contrast this with the results in Louisiana. Hope remains that 300,000 Louisiana residents would be added to the Medicaid rolls because Louisiana elected a new Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, who said it would be his first agenda item once sworn in. That has changed in the last few days as Edwards is now walking back that statement as state officials work on the details. Observers are giving Edwards credit for naming state Sen. Ben Nevers as his chief of staff. Nevers is one of the strongest supporters of Medicaid expansion in the Louisiana legislature. Edwards served in the state assembly. His Opponent, U.S. Senator David Vitter, tried to make a big issue out of Syrian refugees immigrating to the U.S. While Louisiana works on health reform technicalities, then, Medicaid expansion is dead for the time being in Virginia. Terry McAuliffe had failed in his effort to woo Republicans to allow 400,000 Virginians to get health insurance. Republicans say Medicare is expansive and provides poor quality health care. What McAuliffe tried to do in the elections was zero in on a handful of legislative races: His strategy was to win a majority in the Senate and force Republicans to negotiate with him. Only 26 percent of registered voters in Virginia voted. Virginia Democrats now have to figure out way to turn out their base, especially entering the 2016 presidential season. Now, health care reform in Virginia is in hands of a future Democratic governor, assuming they have the votes. McAuliffe will spend the rest of his term drumming up economic development and helping elect Hillary Clinton, with whom he is politically aligned. There were some minor victories in Virginia, however. Democrats gained three seats in the House of Delegates. Democrats in this chamber can fend off a veto override vote if they stand together.

The battle for the majority continues outside the election cycle. Northam can offer incumbent GOP lawmakers jobs in his administration, creating pickup opportunities for Democrats. Then-Gov. Jim Gilmore (R) used that tactic in 1998 to erode Democratic majorities in the legislature. Even if politicking and parliamentary maneuvering puts Democrats over the top, some of the more liberal members of the General Assembly say they are realistic about the prospects of far-left legislation. Kim Propeack, a leader of the pro-immigrant group CASA in Action, said Virginia Democrats should resist the urge to be overly cautious. Comments The story must be told.

If Democrats flip just one seat, however, they will take control of the chamber with the deciding vote from Democrat Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam. McAuliffe has a powerful ally in this election; New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg. It would also provide Bloomberg with a key talking point that gun restrictions can be politically popular in swing states ahead of the pivotal 2016 elections. The Virginia Senate elections are simply the highest profile of a number of proxy battles being fought this year in down-ballot races. In Colorado, millions have been spent on a school board election in Jefferson County, home to Golden, CO. Conservative groups have tried to counter the union spending, but will likely be vastly outspent. The fight is widely seen by many as a proxy for the fight over education reform. The measures supported by the conservatives are modest and generally popular with voters. The unions understand, however, that if the conservatives lose, other supporters of education reform will be reluctant to push policy proposals. These races rarely attract a lot of political attention. They won 6 of the 8 seats up for election. Another proxy fight is on the ballot in San Francisco. Successful ballot initiatives in cities like San Fran often become templates for new laws and regulations in other states. Voters in the critical swing state will decide Tuesday between two measures that would legalize pot in the Buckeye State. Ohio would be the most populous state to legalize pot. It is also a major midwestern state, far from the Mountain and Pacific West that is already moving towards legalization. Culturally, it would be a watershed moment and possibly force Presidential candidates to take a position on the issue. If the measure fails on Tuesday, it could return to the ballot next November, in time to boost turnout among younger voters. These proxy fights are healthy in our federalist system. Most decisions concerning laws and regulations ought to be decided at the state and local level. Conservatives in the 1980s and 1990s used local fights like these to frame the political landscape for larger battles. With Republicans in solid control of Congress, the left now has rediscovered state and local elections as a way to push their policies. While conservatives devote their energies to affecting change in Washington, large segments of the left are returning to local elections. If Democrats are able to win the state Senate, even partially on the back of the gun control issue, it will embolden gun control supporters in other states. New Virginia Majority, a new voter group, is testing get-out-the-vote efforts with non-English speakers. National conservatives, however, who rhetorically embrace the principle of federalism are largely absent from these contests.

But further down ballot, the usually sleepy state legislative contests are drawing an unusual surge of interest from Democrats across the country. President Trump's election sprouted a network of activists who want to flip seats blue. It served as a wake-up call for Democrats to pay attention to lower-profile state races as a way to chart a path back to power. For a new crop of Democratic groups, Virginia is the opening salvo and a testing ground ahead of what they hope is a wave election in 2018. It's also a purple state where Democrats have been winning statewide since 2009, but Republicans hold 66 of the 100 seats in the House of Delegates. An organization founded by wealthy Virginia donors and bankrolled by a Silicon Valley entrepreneur is beta-testing technology to help low-budget campaigns run more efficiently. Activists in solidly Democratic states are forming groups to help Virginia from afar, by fundraising and making phone calls. They benefit from a massive war chest accumulated after years of controlling the chamber, increased financial support from the long-standing Republican State Leadership Committee and the name recognition and legislative record that comes with incumbency. While Democrats this year have also looked for clues about 2018 in a handful of special elections to fill congressional vacancies around the country, Virginia's legislative races may be a better bellwether because the turnout will be similar to the midterms, said David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Many disagree about whether to pour resources into races perceived as winnable, such as those where the Republican incumbent is retiring or where Hillary Clinton prevailed last year or whether to try to expand the map to red-leaning rural and suburban districts. Not every lesson from Virginia will translate to other states. Lax finance campaign rules in the Old Dominion allow groups to pour in unlimited sums and directly coordinate with campaigns. New groups, new tools Democratic nominee for the 2nd district of the Virginia House of Delegates Jennifer Carroll Foy fires up supporters before they hit the local area in a canvassing event on Oct. 22 in Woodbridge, Va. Foy's campaign manager Teddy Smyth (himself plucked from an outside group: the Progressive Campaign Change Committee) has a spreadsheet on his computer keeping track of 73 representatives of outside groups coming to her aid. They include a Sister District program in Massachusetts raising money, a group of Los Angeles filmmakers cutting a campaign ad and a D.C. organization deploying canvassers. Also on Smyth's laptop are portals to technology tools provided by new groups trying to help shoestring campaigns. That saves campaign staffers time spent calling volunteers. Others are lending their star power to down-ballot races. Democrat Jason Kander drew national attention in 2016 after nearly unseating Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) in a state Trump handily won. Now he heads Let America Vote, a group that aims to combat gerrymandering and voter suppression. That's success, Kander says.

But another important battle is underway in the great state of Virginia. Currently the state senate there features a narrow 21-19 Republican majority. That status is being sorely tested. With most races already decided, Republicans look to be in good shape to hold 19 seats and Democrats can feel pretty good about holding 17 of their own and earning at least one takeover. That leaves 3 seats - and the majority - up for grabs. Here are the contests I'm following. They will decide which party owns the gavel come January. District 10: Daniel Gecker (D) appears headed for a takeover (see update below). If things were to end as they currently stand, Democrats would earn one takeover and bring the balance of power in the Virginia Senate to a 20-20 tie. But since Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam is a Democrat, the blue team would hold the effective majority. I'll be updating this post to reflect how these four races develop throughout the next couple hours. Update (10:10pm): I got a tip from a follower on Twitter that the race in District 10 may not be a takeover after all. That said, the low turnout nature of this election may still not provide Republican Glen Sturtevant enough of a boost to overcome the deficit he faces. Update2 (10:35pm): Well, it looks like enough Republican voters came out in Powhatan County to indeed overwhelm that 3,600 vote lead Gecker enjoyed. Congratulations to Glen Sturtevant. He has held onto District 10 for the GOP and has held the Senate in Republican hands."}

But Northam says he is not looking to vanquish the other side. After an ugly gubernatorial campaign ended in a surprising Democratic sweep that reverberated across the nation, voters don't want showboating, he said. The Virginia results were widely interpreted as a repudiation by voters of Donald Trump's first year in the White House. The Republican president proved so unpopular that a wave of Democrats swept into office; in the House of Delegates, a 66-34 Republican majority vanished. The GOP is hanging onto a 51-49 edge, with recounts underway in three close races. The outcome was a harbinger of the Democratic tide that upended the Senate race in Alabama last week and set the stage for elections nationwide next year. He blamed Gillespie for inflaming the rhetoric by focusing on the Latino street gang MS-13 and suggesting Northam wanted to restore voting rights to a pedophile. A moderate Democrat who was once courted to switch parties by the Republicans, Northam was never a natural standard-bearer for the progressive activists who helped power the Democratic elections this year. Some in the new wave of delegates coming to Richmond have been openly critical of the party's establishment. I'll try to lead that. We talk about the doctor being in, healing, and I'll try to bring people together and emphasize doing what's in the best interest of Virginia. That's echoed in his promise not to try to engineer a Democratic advantage in the legislature. Other governors with a closely divided House or Senate have dangled well-paying Cabinet jobs to lure a lawmaker from the opposite party to leave the Assembly and tilt the balance of power. It has been widely assumed that Northam is considering such a move, with Republicans holding a 21-19 edge in the state Senate and incoming Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, a Democrat, in a position to break tie votes. But Northam ruled that out. Similarly, Northam said he has no plans to try to force Republicans to accept a broad expansion of Medicaid. Instead, he has begun talks with lawmakers in both parties about overhauling the state's Medicaid system to expand access to health care while better defining eligibility to control costs. Outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) tried every year to push the legislature to accept millions in federal money to expand the health program to hundreds of thousands of low-income Virginians. Northam campaigned heavily on the promise of getting more Virginians access to health care. He said Friday that he remains committed to that pledge, but that he must be careful about obligating the state to escalating costs. Under the program, the federal government pays the lion's share in the early years but the state contribution gradually increases. He said he is consulting with legislators on both sides of the aisle to draw up the plans, as well as with retired state senator John Watkins, a Republican who worked on an earlier effort to create a state marketplace for private health insurance plans. The General Assembly will convene Jan. 10. He conceded that he can't match McAuliffe's salesmanship and manic dealmaking, and said the emphasis may shift from recruiting new employers to improving the climate for existing businesses. In that climate, Virginia could be a test case for whether political unity is still a viable route. Northam said national party figures have told him the Virginia results lifted up demoralized Democrats. His campaign staff has gotten queries from people looking to strategize in some of the 36 gubernatorial races or various House and Senate races set for around the country next year, he said. But asked if he had heard anything from the recent Doug Jones campaign, Northam drew a blank. Northam has yet to take any time off since the election and, aside from speaking engagements, has been swamped with interviewing job candidates for the Cabinet or state agencies. In his transition office near the Capitol, he constantly hears the roar and beeping of crews demolishing the old General Assembly office building next door. Symbolic or not, that demolition fits with what Northam says is a drive to push ideas of openness into state government. He'd like new state offices to be built with open floor plans, and hopes to have the governor's office outfitted with glass. He'd like more parking for visitors to the Capitol. A classic-car buff who restored a 1953 Oldsmobile with his brother and tinkers on a 1971 Corvette, Northam lit up when he said he'd like to invite car clubs to hold shows around the Executive Mansion and Capitol. Provided, he added, he can get permission from Susan Clarke Schaar, the longtime clerk of the Senate who keeps a tight rein on decorum. Northam's own future ambition is unclear. He hesitated to run for lieutenant governor four years ago but McAuliffe persuaded him. At least one Democratic official said recently that Northam has said he has no desire to run for anything after being governor. But on Friday, he dodged that question.

A few things jumped out at me: Not surprisingly, Virginia General Assembly Republicans are absolutely abysmal when it comes to energy and environmental issues. For instance, not a single one has pledged not to accept money from Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power. Cumulative points were then divided by the total number of opportunities to vote, creating a score that represents the likelihood that these legislators will support environmentally progressive policy. This year, Sen. Howell (D-Reston), Del. Hope (D-Arlington), Del. Levine (D-Arlington), Del. Lopez (D-Arlington) and Del. Del. Hope and Del. Lopez have scored a 100 percent every year since 2016. The environmental issues evaluated include water quality, solar energy development, fracking, energy efficiency, flood protection, electric utility regulation and coal ash cleanup.

This means the ongoing Medicaid expansion fight will likely die in the upcoming General Assembly session. In the House of Delegates, a small number of seats flipped to opposing parties. Dan Gecker greets supporters and volunteers, saying he won't concede the hotly-contested 10th district Senate seat. Sturtevant won by 1,494 votes. Glen Sturtevant will now replace Republican Senator John Watkins, who had served the 10th district since 1998 and announced plans to retire last year. The Parrish family has held elected office in Manassas and Prince William County for decades. The seat had previously been held by 89-year-old Democrat Charles Colgan, the longest serving state senator in Virginia history, who opted not to run for re-election. The district profile tilts strongly toward Democrats, and McPike ran a campaign centered on education and transportation issues. He spoke with CBS affiliate WDBJ in downtown Roanoke while the final votes were tallied. Across town, Dye conceded from the Holiday Inn near Tanglewood Mall. Both Stanley and Adkins have made headlines in the weeks leading up to the election. Stanley reported to police a Facebook comment from Andy Parker that he interpreted as a threat. Parker is a gun control advocate and the father of Alison Parker, the WDBJ reporter shot on live TV. Stanley, an outspoken Second Amendment supporter, responded to the post by obtaining concealed carry permits for both himself and his wife. The Martinsville Police Department are investigating. Democrats had attacked Tracci - a former federal prosecutor with no experience in state courts - but he pledged to learn the ropes quickly. Credit Robert Tracci Tracci had earlier said he would not consider low-level, non-violent drug offenses a priority. In other races, Democrats in Charlottesville and Albemarle County had reason to celebrate. After years of partisan battles on the Albemarle County Board, Democrats are now in complete control with Norman Dill and Rick Randolph winning contested seats. Kathy Galvin, who was re-elected to the Charlottesville City Council, says the voters have cleared the way for regional cooperation and progress on some very big issues. To be in partnership as opposed to be antagonistic toward each other only makes sense, and the public has told us that. Enough of this old ax to grind. Construction stopped in 2009, and the city has been unable to get the current owner - Dewberry Capital of Atlanta - to resume work on the property. The top vote getter for city council was Wes Bellamy who lost his last bid for the office by five votes. It's a critical seat, but behind every student who follows local elections, there are a couple more who don't. The auditorium was almost full with students who clearly care about politics. In the running: Democrat Dan Gecker, Republican Glen Sturtevant, Marleen Durfee, an independent and Carl Loser, a libertarian. Although some of the seats are fiercely contested, a lack of competition throughout the state may be part of the problem."}

In NC I was about to have a Democratic Governor, Lt Governor and AG. Adios Bob Marshall. NC revoked its state voting rights act, lifted the moratorium on fracking, and set out to destroy virtually all the progress of the last 100 years. In short, despite the fact that I still love NC, we have become a national embarrassment. Out with an unpopular Gov. Bev Perdue (and markedly better one than what we have now). She did not disappoint (him). Singularly unqualified and ideologically wingy she made an incredible mess. So, weep Mr. Governor, but not for Aldona Wos. If he promises something, he will not deliver. The women of NC know better than to ever trust the man who is now Governor Ultrasound, Jr, but promised otherwise. Virginia, on the other hand, since 2013, has a governor who is surprising (for the better) even those (such as myself) who supported him the first time he ran, but lost. And you got a budget in a timely manner too. We still have none. McAuliffe has shown himself to have the diplomatic skill balanced with feisty courage needed to get things done. You know the cliche is true: Elections have consequences. You have such an important election coming up this fall. Things are on the upswing in Virginia. The Virginia Senate hangs in the balance. And there is a glimmer of hope you can possibly take the House. I keep getting requests for money by email, snail mail and by phone, even, from Virginia candidates. If we are ever to fight back against the Kochs and their NC buddy in Ayn Randian-Bircher-Tea Party-extremism, Art Pope, we need to focus closer to home where my donations belong. What I can do is write about them, as I will in coming weeks. What affects Virginia, our neighbor to the north, is still very important to me. You already know every election matters. Especially yours in 2015. Please donate to your candidates. Register voters. If someone gets inappropriately knocked off the voting rolls, help legally get them back on. Get them to turn out. Shine a strong light on and resist any inkling of vote suppression by the other side. Come on Virginia, give us down here hope.

So the RGA could pull the money out of Virginia if it later decides it is better spent elsewhere. The Virginia Public Access Project disclosed the record donation Friday. The Republicans running for governor are: Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and counselor to then-President George W.

Governor Terry McAuliffe enters house chambers the State of the Commonwealth address in front of the Virginia general assembly inside the state capitol in Richmond, Va. on Wednesday, January 14, 2015. A total of 122 Virginia legislators sought re-election Tuesday. Not a one was defeated. Turnout on Tuesday was just over 26 percent statewide, according to unofficial voter tallies from the State Board of Elections. For instance, Republican Amanda Chase, who was elected Tuesday in the 11th Senate District, had stunned Sen. Stephen H. Martin, R-Chesterfield, in a June primary. Dels. Mark J. Berg, R-Frederick, and Johnny S. Joannou, D-Portsmouth, also were ousted in June primaries. Thomas M. Bolvin, R-Fairfax, defeated by Democrat Mark D. Sickles. In the last 20 years, the lowest re-election percentage for incumbents was in 2009, when nine of the 89 delegates seeking re-election lost their seats, VPAP said. That year the state Senate was not up for election. On Oct. 22, a three-judge panel upheld the constitutionality of 12 majority-black districts in the House of Delegates. Plaintiffs backed by lawyers affiliated with the Democratic Party argued that the districts diluted the voting power of African-Americans, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. That suit, backed by the nonpartisan redistricting reform group OneVirginia2021, challenges six Republican-held districts and five Democrat-held districts. It challenges boundaries of five House districts and six state Senate districts.

News4's Tom Sherwood reports. Not that you'd necessarily know that. This is a low-key election. There aren't a lot of competitive races, and it's an off-year for politics -- all of which could lead to low turnout. But this election matters -- possibly more than you think it does. So here are four things you need to know about the Nov. 3 election. Some basics: Polls will be open from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. Click here to find your polling location. Voters in Virginia are required to show a photo ID to vote, but that ID does not have to show the voter's address. 1. Voters Could Shift Balance of Power in Va. Senate While Republicans are expected to maintain control in the House of Delegates, the Democrats only need to pick up one seat to gain control of the Senate. Right now, Republicans have 21 seats to the Democrats' 19. Democrats believe they will pick up a seat in the Richmond area, where Chesterfield Supervisor Dan Gecker (D) faces Glen Sturtevant (R). But District 29 in Prince William County is also considered a competitive race. If Democratic candidate Jeremy McPike wins the seat, the Democrats could regain control. If both parties end up with 20 seats, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) will cast the tie-breaking vote. 2. Many Voters Won't See Very Many Choices on Their Ballot While there are some competitive races, many voters will not see many options on their ballot. In the state Senate, 22 out of 40 races have more than one candidate, but only six are expected to be close. In the House, only 38 out of 100 have two or more candidates, with only a handful expected to be competitive. The chief architect of the 2011 Republican legislative redistricting plan testified in federal court earlier this year that raw political self-interest was at work when the maps were being drawn. Del. S. Chris Jones testified that he tried to accommodate requests from 75 to 80 delegates who sought to tweak lines, sometimes to draw out precincts where they had historically performed poorly or to draw out a potential primary challenger. But those requests were made by Republicans and Democrats alike, and GOP lawmakers dispute that the current map is squelching competition. 3. Low Voter Turnout Means Every Vote Counts Low voter turnout has led to some surprising upsets in years past. Last year, Eric Cantor's defeat to Tea Party candidate Dave Brat cost the number two House Republican his seat in Congress and left the political world in shock. Locally, Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille blamed low turnout when he lost the Democratic mayoral primary to councilmember Allison Silberberg. Silberberg won by just over 300 votes. Euille has been mayor since 2003, and had never been opposed prior to this summer. There's no Republican candidate on the ballot. from loading. All rights reserved."}

While officials say the hackers scanned the state's public website and online voter registration system for vulnerabilities and there's no sign they gained access, state authorities have been shoring up the security of their election systems. Politics 10 Months After Election Day, Feds Tell States More About Russian Hacking One of the most drastic steps was a decision by the Virginia Board of Elections earlier this month to order 22 counties and towns to adopt all new paper-backed voting machines before November. The board decided that the paperless electronic equipment they had been using was vulnerable to attack and should be replaced. Within days, Falls Church ordered a new voting system that combines paper ballots with optical scan machines. The paper ballots are filled out by voters, scanned and then stored in a locked bin and can be counted later if the machine-scanned tally is questioned. He notes a leaked National Security Agency report that Russian intelligence agencies sent malicious e-mails last year to more than 100 local election offices as part of a phishing attack. There's no evidence any of those offices were compromised. National Security Report: Russia Launched Cyberattack On Voting Vendor Ahead Of Election National Security Russian Cyberattack Targeted Elections Vendor Tied To Voting Day Disruptions Then this summer, hackers at a convention in Las Vegas easily broke into some of the paperless voting machines used in Virginia, which is one reason the state banned them so abruptly. Cortes says he isn't worried so much about hackers changing votes as he is about someone causing confusion at the polls by tampering with something like the voter registration lists. To prepare for such possibilities, Cortes and others in his office met in Richmond two weeks ago with representatives of the state police, the state IT agency, county registrars, emergency managers and others to go over Election Day contingency plans that prioritize making sure voters can continue casting ballots no matter what. In the past, such pre-election meetings have focused on potential incidents like hurricanes and power failures, but this year there's a new sense of urgency. And that's always a possibility. There's no evidence any votes were affected, but Russian hackers last year were able to gain access to Illinois' statewide voter registration database, and the username and password of an election worker in Arizona. This year, Virginia gave its local registrars special cybersecurity training, on things such as how to detect a phishing attack and protect passwords. The state is also working more closely with federal authorities. Bob Kolasky, acting deputy undersecretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), says his agency is now in weekly contact with election officials in Virginia and New Jersey. Kolasky says he hasn't seen any such signs yet, but promises that if there are, the agency will be more open to sharing data than it was last year. States complained they were denied important information about threats to their election systems, making it more difficult for them to ensure they were secure. DHS is also in the process of getting security clearances for the top election official in each state so they'll have access to classified intelligence about cybersecurity threats. Election security watchdogs say they're encouraged, especially by Virginia's decision to get rid of its paperless machines. Still, Susan Greenhalgh, of a group called Verified Voting, says using paper ballots is only the first step, and that they need to be counted to detect tampering. Virginia plans to start conducting such post-election audits, but not until after next year's election."}

{"URL_s":"http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/virginia-midterm-monkeyshines-as-primaries-approach","Timestamp_s":"20180819002502","Sentences_t":"There is no state election this year, just federal Midterms and some local races. At the federal level, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D) is up for re-election. His Republican opponent will be one of three members of the far-right fringe. The strongest appears to be Corey Stewart, who chairs the County Board of Supervisors in Prince William County. Stewart has made a name for himself nationally by means of lurid immigrant-bashing speeches and, even though he is from Minnesota, defending the Southern heritage as epitomized by statues and place names that glorify the Confederacy and its leaders. All three Republicans opposed a major legislative victory for the people of Virginia, the expansion of Medicaid coverage to about 400,000 low income Virginians: Stewart and Freitas explicitly and Jackson implicitly, given that the expansion depends on the continuation of the ACA which Jackson wants to abolish. Stewart was vitriolic toward the Republican members of the State Senate who joined all the Democrats to pass the legislation. Going into the primaries, Kaine, who has no Democratic primary challenger, appears to be safely ensconced in his Senate seat, irrespective of which right-wing extremist gets the Republican nomination. But there are five months to go until the general election. Flipping GOP House seats Virginia has eleven House seats, occupied currently by four Democrats and seven Republicans. It would appear that none of the Democrats are currently in danger, either in the primary or in the general election. Up until recently, the only one that seemed to be in play was the seat of Republican Barbara Comstock in the 10th Congressional District. It is a wealthy area but has seen demographic changes which have put it into play. Originally eleven people jumped into the Democratic Primary; that total is now down to six. The Washington Post and many others have endorsed State Senator Jennifer Wexton for the position. Our Revolution of Northern Virginia, inspired by the Bernie Sanders campaign, has endorsed political newcomer Julia Biggins, a medical research scientist who supports single-payer healthcare (Medicare for All) and free Pre-K and tuition-free community college, among other progressive positions. Up until recently, this article would have ended at this point. Most interesting, perhaps, is the Fifth Congressional District, which stretches from the North Carolina border in the south, along the Appalachian foothills up to northern Virginia. It is mostly rural and mostly white, which is why it has elected Republicans in recent House elections. But in 2008, it elected left-of-center Democrat Tom Perriello. Perriello was ousted by Republican Robert Hurt in 2010. Hurt won again in 2012 and 2014, but then retired and was replaced by Republican Thomas Garrett Jr. in 2016. Many assumed that Garrett was a shoo-in for re-election, but now he is utterly disgraced and has stepped out of the re-election race. Members of his congressional staff had complained that Garrett and his wife had been using them, against House rules, as servants to run personal errands, including cleaning up after their dog. In announcing that he is ending his re-election campaign, Garrett did not cite this scandal, but rather his struggle with alcoholism. Whiskey Rebellion So, the Republican Party in the Fifth Congressional District had to engage in a mad, last minute scramble to find a replacement for Garrett. They met on Saturday Morning, June 2, to decide between the most likely candidates, former military intelligence officer and distiller Denver Riggleman and religious activist Cynthia Dunbar. Though both are far to the right, it is possible that Dunbar was too extreme even for the Trump era Republican party, as she is on record calling, on biblical principles, for the end of the separation of church and state, of government aid to the poor and of public education. Riggleman is also hard right. He is a big supporter of the Trump tax cuts, for the same reason. He opposes one of the pipeline projects in Virginia, not so much because it is a threat to the environment, but because it will interfere with the property rights of people through whose land it will pass. Turnout, as always, will be the key This is still an uphill fight for Cockburn but given the controversies over Garrett and Trump and the possibility of an increased turnout of the Democratic Party base, she might just pull off a victory. In the 2016 presidential elections, Trump beat Clinton in the Fifth Congressional District by 53.11 percent to 42.09 percent, with the rest going to minor candidates. The successful Medicaid expansion effort was made possible by that electoral victory, so if turnout of the Democratic base is high enough, possibly Cockburn can be elected. In the Fifth Congressional District, as in the rest of Virginia, overwhelmingly white rural districts have been voting Republican, but medium-sized towns and cities, especially those with large numbers of African American voters, have been giving the Democrats big margins. The Fifth Congressional district includes, for example, Charlottesville, the university town where the far right organized a deadly riot last August, and Danville, a fifty percent African-American city on the North Carolina border.

Although the state legislature is controlled by Republicans, all five statewide offices are held by Democrats. The state also voted blue in the past three presidential contests, including in November when Virginia was the only Southern state that Hillary Clinton won. Northam, who was once courted by Republicans to switch parties, is emphasizing his support for abortion rights and gun control in a state where Democrats once tread carefully on such issues. Last week, he backed marijuana decriminalization as a racial justice issue. Since his surprising entry into the race in January, Perriello has been pitching himself as a populist capable of turning out voters. And he has positioned himself as an environmentalist, breaking from Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and Northam by opposing two planned natural gas pipelines in the state. The day after he launched his gubernatorial campaign, Perriello penned a lengthy post on Facebook apologizing for the vote and defending abortion rights. On the campaign trail, he said he was proud to vote for the Affordable Care Act, even if it meant losing his 2010 reelection, as well as measures to combat climate change. After his loss, Perriello led the lobbying arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal Washington think tank, where he argued for gun control and abortion access. supported gun rights. Northam stands by those labels on budget matters, but says he has never wavered on social issues such as abortion access, gun restrictions and LGBT equality. But some political analysts say a liberal agenda in voter-rich urban areas such as Northern Virginia can be a winning strategy in the state. Neither Perriello, raised in a small town outside Charlottesville, nor Northam, who speaks with the Southern drawl of his native Eastern Shore, have written off rural voters. They both plan to address economic inequality with them. Perriello has been barnstorming the state since he joined the race. Northam has been tethered to Richmond, where he must preside over the state Senate during its legislative session until it ends Feb. 25. Democrats say the competing appeals are good for the party and will fire up more voters ahead of November. Gregory S. Schneider contributed to this report. Comments The story must be told.

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. Day Five, Unchallenged Incumbents. Day Six, Present Opportunities. Day Seven, Democratic Trends. In the last half-decade, Virginia Democrats have seen a range of elections that allow us to roughly identify geographic areas of ticket-splitters. Or switched back and forth in 2013 between Sarvis, Northam, and Obenshain. Obviously, there were far more McCain-Warner voters than there were Romney-Kaine voters. But even though the scale was different, the relative size of these ticket-splitters and where they are concentrated can tell us a lot. For example, the Southwest Virginia delegate districts of the 1st, 9th, 6th, and 3rd had the highest number of McCain-Warner voters in the state. But in 2012, these same districts were still in the top twenty of Romney-Kaine voters. There are ancestral Democrats here, but simply not enough to make seats competitive for our General Assembly candidates. Even though Kaine and Warner had similar areas of crossover appeal, the degree was significantly different. While Warner ran dramatically ahead of Obama in 2008, Tim Kaine managed only small, but noticeable, increases in his share of the vote in Southwest Virginia and elsewhere. The areas where Warner received his strongest crossover vote tended to correlate with the areas of Virginia where Deeds ran strongest in 2009, relative to the shellacking that McDonnell gave him. Another trend is that Mark Warner ran most ahead of Barack Obama in the House of Delegates districts that are not remotely competitive. In other words, the districts that are closest to Democrats in the House of Delegates are not the districts where Mark Warner and Tim Kaine have significant, broad crossover appeal. It was also the second best district for Tim Kaine in terms of crossover support. In 2009, there was more crossover in the most competitive seats. Part of this can be explained by the geography of the candidates. Bob McDonnell probably pulled more voters in Tidewater than a similar Republican, while Jody Wagner increased the crossover back to the Democrats in these same seats. The 21st in Virginia Beach was a clear example of this trend. The crossover is not entirely explained just by the geography of the candidates. In 2013, we see more variance because of the influence of Sarvis voters. With a small SuperPAC behind him, Sarvis ran strongest in the Roanoke and Richmond media markets. These markets are not home to many of the competitive districts we care about. For example, the 13th, 31st, 32nd, 50th, and 51st had some of the lowest levels of crossover voters (among the statewide offices) in the state. In the 32nd and 31st not only did Terry McAuliffe win, but the Democratic strength continued down to Mark Herring. And in both of these districts, voters showed less interest in swinging back and forth between the three statewide elections than elsewhere. Yet in each district, the local Democratic challenged ran behind the rest of the ticket. Terry McAuliffe has moved the Democratic Party of Virginia in the right direction, focusing our campaigning and appeal in the most competitive districts. On the other hand, our current crop of Senators has personal appeal in the less competitive areas. When you look at the areas with the highest crossover appeal in the last few election cycles, both in the Senate elections and in the odd-year elections, none of them are frontline districts. All of this sets up an interesting contrast between Republicans and Democrats. Over the last decade or more, Republicans have continued to make gains in the parts of the state that are on the decline, particularly Southwest Virginia. But the most successful Democrats in Virginia have struggled to find a way to appeal to significant blocks of voters in the most competitive districts.

Senate races to watch on election day Alan SudermanAssociated Press RICHMOND, Va. Republicans currently enjoy a 21-19 advantage, but Democrats can take control by gaining one seat thanks to Democrat Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam's status as a tiebreaker. Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is coming up to the midpoint of his term in office, has invested heavily in helping his party take control of the Senate. Doing so would help him gain leverage against a House of Delegates dominated by the GOP. And both parties are looking for a morale boost ahead of the 2016 presidential election, in which swing-state Virginia is likely to play a key role. The retirement of two moderate longtime senators, one Republican and one Democrat, has led to two highly watched open-seat contests. And there are four incumbents who may be vulnerable. The district has leaned slightly Democratic in recent statewide elections. Democrats are hoping Dan Gecker, a developer and Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors member, can flip the seat. He's made women's health issues and the need to expand Medicaid in Virginia top campaign themes. Gecker has also been a major funder of his own campaign. His major financial backer includes a Washington-based GOP group largely backed by corporate interests and a state-based tea party group. Libertarian Carl Loser and independent Marleen Durfee are also running. Longtime Democratic Sen. Charles J. Colgan is retiring. Like Watkins, Colgan is a political moderate who occasionally crossed the aisle. Republicans are hopeful that Hal Parrish, the mayor of Manassas, can draw on his long-standing local ties to turn the District red. Parrish's father was also mayor of Manassas and served in the House of Delegates. Parrish is running against Democrat Jeremy McPike, an administrator for the city of Alexandria. Republicans are hoping Lewis will have less success this year against GOP challenger Richard Ottinger. Campaigning in the 6th District is not easy, as it includes parts of Hampton Roads, a portion of the middle peninsula and all of the Eastern Shore. Both candidates are lawyers. Democrats had high hopes for McCollum, a former cable executive who was recruited by McAuliffe's office. But McCollum misstated his military record during the early part of the campaign, a possible lethal misstep in a district home to many active and retired service members. Black gained international attention when he wrote a letter to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad thanking him for defending Syrian Christians; he subsequently earned explicit condemnation from the Islamic State militant group. Domestically, Black has garnered attention in the General Assembly as one of its most outspoken abortion opponents. Democrats have nominated pediatrician Jill McCabe to run against him. She was recruited by Northam, the lieutenant governor, to run. Caldwell, Roanoke's commonwealth attorney, could take enough votes away from incumbent Democrat John Edwards to help Republican Nancy Dye win. Edwards is a longtime senator and one of the few remaining Democrats in the General Assembly left in the western part of the state. Dye is a retired physician."}

Terry McAuliffe after a rally in Old Town Alexandria in October. McAuliffe described the elections as a life-or-death choice for his agenda. There is excitement. McAuliffe said a Democratic Senate could give him another chance at Medicaid expansion, gun restrictions and universal pre-kindergarten, which evaporated with the surprise resignation of a Democratic senator from southwest Virginia and flipped the Senate to Republican control. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a tax-increase coup in 2004. But back then, Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. Republicans today boast a supermajority in the House and hope to pick up additional seats Tuesday. For McAuliffe, winning Senate control is more about bragging rights and giving Democrats a tail wind heading into 2016, Farnsworth said. McAuliffe hopes to deliver Virginia for his close friend and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton. He could use the momentum of a Senate flip to help Clinton heading into the March 1 Super Tuesday contests. Republicans are just as keen to have that momentum on their side. Even though the electorate that turns out for off-year elections is more Republican than in presidential years, holding the Senate would feed a GOP narrative that Virginia is leaning red. The symbolic value has made the Senate contests uncommonly intense and expensive. Indeed, 17 of the 40 Senate seats are uncontested, as are 62 of 100 House slots. Democrat Dan Gecker is battling Republican Glen Sturtevant to replace retiring Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan), who represents parts of Richmond and surrounding suburbs. Two issues rose to sudden prominence in the final weeks of the campaign. Across Northern Virginia, Republicans waged a coordinated campaign against the incendiary issue of tolling Interstate 66, putting Democrats on the defensive. McAuliffe, who has said he wants to give single drivers the option of paying to drive in carpool lanes, countered with claims that Parrish and the Republicans are lying. Still, many of his fellow Democrats backed away from the plan. Anti-toll protesters greeted McAuliffe outside a rally in Loudoun on Sunday. Separately, a massive ad buy bankrolled by an independent group thrust gun control to the forefront of two hotly contested races. Gary T. McCollum had billed himself as an active member of the Army Reserve when, in fact, he had been discharged 14 years earlier. McCollum said he had misunderstood his status in the Individual Ready Reserve, which does not require regular drills. The revelation was viewed as a big blow in a district full of military veterans. Lewis is defending a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger is Republican Richard H. Ottinger. The McCollum-Lewis rally was one of nine appearances McAuliffe was scheduled to make Sunday with nine more set for Monday and Tuesday. McAuliffe and Edwards were scheduled to attend three church services, visit a diner and participate in a kickoff for door-to-door canvassing. McAuliffe also appeared with Warner at a rally on behalf of Democrat Jill McCabe, who is challenging Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun), a perennial Democratic target because of his opposition to abortion. Over the past week, six-figure donations have poured into some of those hard-fought races.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

Virginia election results 2017: Live maps, analysis, complete updates View Graphic Tom Davis, the former GOP congressman who represented Northern Virginia, drew the opposite conclusion after Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) ran up huge margins Tuesday in counties such as Loudoun and Prince William. It motivated the Democratic base. Democrats came out en masse in protest. Once a reliable Republican bastion, the commonwealth turned purple as President Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012, victories driven by a growing and diversifying population in Northern Virginia. Another sign of the state's shift leftward was when Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) defeated Republican Ken Cuccinelli II in 2013, breaking a streak of nine elections in which the party controlling the White House lost the governor's race. The signs of Republican frustration over the state's transformation were evident last night on social media after the results came in. Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, appeared to blame the loss on the dominance of the suburbs outside Washington. But with Democrats surpassing expectations in Virginia's legislative races last night, Republicans said the party needs to reassess the message it is conveying to voters. Voters are sending a message to Republicans that they have to get their act together. People want results, not just rhetoric. Rep. Scott W. Taylor (R-Va.) said that his party's acerbic tone and its embrace of polarizing issues drove up Democratic turnout, which hurt the Republicans. And if I don't agree with him, I'll say it. And I think that contributed to a very high turnout on the Democrat side this time in Virginia. We need to get back to the business of government.

Because the GOP dominates the House, flipping the Senate was the term-limited governor's only hope for building a legislative legacy.Democrats could have taken control by picking up just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), meanwhile, held out hope that the results could change. As of late Tuesday night, Democrat Dan Gecker had not conceded to his opponent, Glen Sturtevant.The governor hinted that the vote counting wasn't over. Having one chamber on McAuliffe's side could have, at least in theory, led to the sort of bipartisan deal-making that allowed then-Gov. Mark R. Warner (D) to pull off a record tax hike in 2004. But Warner could appeal to a host of moderate Senate Republicans and a more closely divided House. McAuliffe faces a more conservative Senate Republican caucus and a House with a wide GOP majority. For that reason, the biggest prize the elections offered was momentum - the opportunity for the winning party to claim that voters in this key presidential swing state were leaning its way one year ahead of the White House contest. McAuliffe, once a record-smashing fundraiser for his close friends Bill and Hillary Clinton, had hoped a win would help sway purple Virginia in 2016. National donors and outside groups on the left and right seized on the state Senate races. Donating in smaller amounts were the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity, the National Rifle Association and the Republican State Leadership Committee. Republicans and Democrats alike went into Tuesday predicting success. But mere hours after the polls opened on Election Day, the Democratic Party of Virginia struck a surprising tone: Don't be surprised if we lose. The party sent out a two-page memo to reporters laying out reasons why this might not be its year. It noted that Republicans tend to vote in off-year elections such as this one, that Democrats are playing in traditionally Republican districts and that money has flowed in from outside groups. In recent years, Democrats have effectively used data to turn out voters for statewide and national races, but in the memo they acknowledged that those voters tend to stay home for local races. Fatigue from a seventh year of the Obama White House hurts even more, Democrats said. The two most hotly contested races were for seats being vacated by two of the Senate's last moderates, both of whom are retiring: Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William) and Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan). According to unofficial results Tuesday night, Republican Sturtevant, a school board member, defeated Democrat Gecker, a Chesterfield County supervisor, for Watkins's seat. Parrish, the Manassas mayor, opposes Medicaid expansion, has an A-minus rating from the NRA and cast the tie-breaking vote allowing restrictions on Manassas abortion clinics. McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, favors Medicaid expansion, gun control and abortion rights. The August shootings of two journalists in southwest Virginia turned gun control into a key issue in the races, as McAuliffe pushed for tighter restrictions on firearms purchases, with the support of Andy Parker, the father of one of the victims. In Loudoun County, Democrat Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency-room doctor, failed to unseat Sen. Richard H. Black, a former Marine combat pilot and lawyer who is among the Assembly's most conservative members. Democrats conceded that unseating Black would be as difficult as their quest to oust incumbent Republican Frank W. Wagner in Virginia Beach. Wagner withstood a challenge from Democrat Gary McCollum. Wagner, the former owner of a ship repair company, seemed vulnerable after reports that he took gifts from special interests and sponsored legislation friendly to Dominion Virginia Power. But McCollum was stung by revelations that he misrepresented his military record. Nearby, Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack) successfully defended a seat he won by just 11 votes last year in a special election. His challenger was Republican Richard H. Ottinger. In southwest Virginia, Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) prevailed in a three-way race against Republican Nancy Dye and Democrat-turned-independent Don Caldwell. Along with gun control, highway tolls came to dominate races in Northern Virginia late in the campaign. Republicans blasted McAuliffe's plan to turn parts of Interstate 66 into a toll road for some commuters during peak hours. Democratic candidates said they opposed it as well, but the GOP contended that they could not be trusted to buck a governor of their own party once in office. They used the attacks against Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) and Democratic state delegate candidates John Bell and Jennifer Boysko. Meanwhile in the House of Delegates, in preliminary returns, Republicans appeared to narrowly lose their veto-proof majority, but they still maintained a huge advantage over Democrats in the polarized chamber. House Democrats picked up two seats in districts formerly held by Republicans who did not seek reelection. Boysko defeated businessman Danny Vargas (R) for Del. Thomas Davis Rust's (R-Fairfax) seat. Bell defeated Republican Chuong Nguyen for the seat held by David I. Ramadan (R-Loudoun). Late Tuesday, Murphy was embroiled in a tight race with Craig Parisot, the Republican she narrowly defeated in a special election last year. This time around, less than 200 votes separated the candidates, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Fairfax County officials said that they will recheck the totals for Murphy and Parisot on Wednesday to see whether a recount is warranted. Late Tuesday, Republican Mark Dudenhefer was leading Democrat Josh King to take back the seat he held for one term before losing it to Michael T. Futrell (D-Prince William). Reading . PA . 19603 ."}

A major part of that, Cannon acknowledged, was that Reeves had experience campaigning as opposed to first time state senate candidate Gallaway who may not have as much experience in fundraising. The 17th district includes the City of Fredericksburg and Orange County as well as parts of Culpeper, Spotsylvania and Louisa counties. According to Cannon, out of the last six state legislature elections incumbents have only been voted out of office 19 times. Statistically, One Virginia 2021 states that the numbers lead to a 3.176 percent chance of an incumbent being voted out of office on Nov. 3 if the trend continues. Cannon attributes the low turnover rate for incumbents to gerrymandering. Cannon said politicians do this so they can understand what kind of life their constituents live and to compile that on top of election data to understand what party the majority of their district votes for. Reeves was previously a target from his predecessor with the power of redistricting. In 2011 Reeves campaigned against the 28-year state senate incumbent veteran, Edd Houck for the 17th district. Cannon said new lines were drawn prior to the election in order to oust Reeves from the district. Reeves said he and his wife, Anne Reeves, decided to move to Virginia after his time spent in the Army as a Second Lieutenant. Reeves said on top of wanting to lay down roots for a family Virginia was a place where as small business owners he and his wife could thrive. If re-elected on Nov. 3, it will be his second term as state senator for the district. Reeves said the campaign was in full swing. Reeves said that as a state senator he has worked to represent and help citizens of the 17th District by keeping to his legislative priorities by ensuring through a limited, efficient government, the government is able to give individuals the ability to create their own prosperity. Reeves is known for championing SB 1222, a bill aimed toward allowing terminally ill patients to have easier access to experimental medication before approval from the FDA. The bill was passed into law during the 2015 General Assembly session. Reeves said he was also proud of getting legislation passed during the session that helps school districts properly identify children with parents in the military and armed services, so that the districts could get the proper amount of funding for these types of students, and so teachers could better understand the students, and work with them given that their families are in a special circumstance. Gallaway said. Gallaway said if elected education would be a priority he would follow through on unlike many politicians who make the promise during campaign and falter on the promise following election. Reeves and Gallaway are both supporters of redistricting reform in Virginia. In his time as senator, Reeves has consistently voted in favor of Senate bills that involve reform for redistricting. account. Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.

In return he gets - no, not thirty pieces of silver, but a seat on the Tobacco Commission and a judgeship for his daughter. You might think that obtaining the job through such sleazebaggery would taint the rest of her career a bit. All I know is that if Republicans want to play such unscrupulous, hardball, no-holds-barred politics, the answer is not to respond by playing patty cake with them. If they are going to take power through dishonest means, just playing along is not the way to honor or maintain a democracy. If they want a fight, let's give them a fight. Let's shout out our protest everywhere from social media to the streets. Democrats should boycott every institution rendered illegitimate by this dirty act, from the General Assembly to Mr. Puckett's daughter's courtroom.

Virginia Politics Twelve Days of Christmas for Virginia Democrats: Day Eight, Swing Voters FreeDem - January 2, 2014 1 Welcome to this twelve-part series looking at the challenges, obstacles, and future possibilities of Virginia Democrats. If you've missed past diaries, follow these links: Day One, Competitive Districts. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. Day Five, Unchallenged Incumbents. Day Six, Present Opportunities. Day Seven, Democratic Trends. For today's poll, I'm asking about your early support for Governor in 2017. In the last half-decade, Virginia Democrats have seen a range of elections that allow us to roughly identify geographic areas of ticket-splitters. I'm talking about folks who came out and voted for Mitt Romney and Tim Kaine. Or switched back and forth in 2013 between Sarvis, Northam, and Obenshain. It's all possible. Virginia Politics Twelve Days of Christmas for Virginia Democrats: Day Six, The Ghost... FreeDem - December 31, 2013 10 We are now halfway through this twelve part series looking at the challenges, obstacles, and future possibilities of Virginia Democrats. If you've missed past diaries, follow these links: Day One, Competitive Districts. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. Day Five, Unchallenged Incumbents. Virginia Democrats may be depressed with the first part of this series, but this holiday season, they have a lot to be thankful for. In honor of this being New Year's Eve, we'll be looking at reasons to look forward to 2014. First, good girls and boys of all ages across Virginia have opened up their invitations to an inauguration featuring three Democratic officials. Combined with Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, the party has demonstrated that the far right is no longer welcome in statewide elections in the Commonwealth. In 2014, Mark Warner will be up for reelection and Virginia Republicans are desperate to find a warm body with a pulse to run against him. Right now, with concerns over the implementation of Obamacare, his numbers may be softer, but this will be temporary as the health care roll out improves in 2014. I question what Republican will be foolish enough to run; Warner will march onward to reelection. Even with a strong challenger, only delusional Tea Partiers believe Warner is truly vulnerable. Virginia Politics Twelve Days of Christmas for Virginia Democrats: Day Five, Unchallenged Incumbents FreeDem - December 30, 2013 10 This is the fifth part of a twelve part series looking at the challenges, obstacles, and future possibilities of Virginia Democrats. Here are the previous diaries: Day One, Competitive Districts. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. To show that you've read this diary and support the project, please vote in the poll at the end. On the fifth day of Christmas, the Commonwealth of Virginia gave to me ... Incumbents who are so safe in their seats they don't remember the last time they had to actually campaign. In 2013, 41 incumbent Delegates were not even challenged by another candidate, either by the other major party or by a minor party candidate. One more was able to win their first election without any challenge at all, walking right into office. That may seem sad, but it's an improvement over 2011, when 59 incumbents were unchallenged in their newly drawn districts. That's similar to elections in 2003, 2005, and 2007, where over 60 delegates on average, almost two-thirds of the chamber, were unchallenged. In the ten years from 2003 to 2013, well over half of all delegate races were unchallenged."}

With Republicans likely to maintain a large majority in the House of Delegates and Democrat Terry McAuliffe sitting in the governor's mansion today's outcome in the senate will have enormous implications for the direction of state government in the immediate future. You've heard the campaign ads, the debates, the speeches, education issues, classroom sizes, economic development is the key, the Second Amendment, new job opportunities, making college more affordable, the balance of power in the Senate, and making certain every child has an opportunity to succeed... The question now is which side will have the upper hand in tackling those issues and a host of others. Virginia Tech political scientist Karen Hult says the stakes are especially high Governor Terry McAuliffe, for whom a Senate controlled by Democrats would provide much greater political leverage during the next two years. Hult sees some potential trouble spots. She's also getting an assist from outside the campaign. Then there's the 6th District on the Eastern Shore where Republican Richard Ottinger hopes to unseat Democrat Lynwood Lewis. Lewis won the seat in a special election two years ago....by eleven votes. The money is roughly even but it's enough so that both can run a pretty good campaign. Republican John Watkins is stepping down in District 10, that's in the Richmond area. Democrat Charles Colgan is giving up the District 29 seat in Prince William County. Hult thinks either or both could flip. At the same time the concern for Democrats has to be getting turnout. The District 10 race may be the most expensive of the year. Parish is opposed by Democrat Jeremy McPike who lost a run for the House of Delegates by one point in 2013. That leaves 17 that are not and of those 23 very few of them are actually competitive. Part of the answer has to be the redistricting that is controlled by the majority party. And that could well be a contributing factor to another constant in General Assembly-only elections, low turnout. Usually about a third of registered voters participate. But must experts believe only about 23-to-29 percent of those registered will vote will show up. Julia Billingsly, is Director of Virginia 21 at Virginia Tech, a non-profit, non-partisan group active at all 13 public, 4-year colleges in Virginia. And she kept at it until the very last day before the deadline to register, the very last hours in fact, she was in the Squires Student Center. What happens with those seats will depend largely on who comes out to vote. You may not have heard much about it though, because many seats are uncontested and not generating much attention. But some state senate races are the exception. Who wins these races could determine the shape of Virginia politics for the next two years. Wayne Boese has always cared about local politics. But, if Democrats win just one extra seat on Tuesday.. that could change."}

Anyone using it must first register by taking a photo of their government-issued identification and a selfie-style video of their face, then upload them via the app. Voatz says its facial recognition software will ensure the photo and video show the same person. Once approved, voters can cast their ballot using the Voatz app. Ballots are anonymized, the company says, and recorded on a public digital ledger called blockchain. Although that technology is most often associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it can be used to record all manner of data. Voatz is one of several companies exploring mobile balloting and recording votes on the blockchain. So far the technology has been limited to trial runs and private elections, such as balloting for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. West Virginia will limit the use of Voatz largely to troops serving abroad. Warner told CNN he is not calling for the replacement of traditional balloting, and said troops can cast paper ballots if they like. But Voatz co-founder and CEO Nimit S. Sawhney sees the state as a springboard to broader use of the technology. Not everyone shares his enthusiasm. Marian K. Schneider, president of the election integrity watchdog group Verified Voting, was even more blunt. She also worries about the lack of a paper trail for electronic votes.

Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. The immediate outpouring of support and enthusiasm from Democrats across the Commonwealth has been incredible, from the crowds of people at our events to the volunteer enthusiasm online. So I want to address you, the hard-working Democrats of Virginia, directly about why I believe our campaign gives Democrats the best chance to defeat the DC lobbyist who wrote the playbook on selling out the middle class and American dream to the highest bidder. Fighting for Our Progressive Coalition Now is a time to fight and to be bold. As automation threatens to disrupt more jobs tomorrow than globalization did yesterday, we must lead the way on creating a new generation of jobs for the working and middle class, provide at least two years of debt-free vocational training or community college, and guarantee no Virginian is a pink slip away from losing healthcare. Hard-working Virginians deserve a raise, time with their families, and the best start for their children. We need a Commonwealth measured not just by our GDP but by our quality of life. We must confront racial demagoguery, with an unambiguous defense of an inclusive Virginia for people of all races and creeds, a state that treats the immigrant who arrived yesterday with the same dignity as the first families. We must advance and protect LGBT rights against those who threaten our sacred equality. With one of the great harbors and bays in the world under threat, we must ensure that our state is at the cutting edge of clean energy, including homegrown power that keeps our dollars in Virginia. We have to stand up to an unhinged corporate gun lobby, keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists, and support best community-policing practices. We must ensure that all women have access to reproductive health services, including family planning and abortion, and protect guarantees of pre- and post-natal care that we fought hard to win in Obamacare and that Trumpism now puts at risk. These bold goals are achievable, but only if we defeat Ed Gillespie, the DC lobbyist who corrupted our state with his radical gerrymandering that represents his clients instead of our citizens. Our Best Chance to Win Democrats win Virginia when we give our powerful, progressive coalition a reason to show up. This is a matter of good policy combined with genuine passion for the fight. Gov. McAuliffe won people over with that energy four years ago, and I am asking for the chance to prove to you and all Virginians that I will fight as hard for you as you do for your own families. Working around the clock, logging tens of thousands of miles, we built a grassroots army, broke every fundraising record for the district, and brought unprecedented state and national attention to the race. We showed that when progressives run on our values, we can win back red districts. In Congress, I was proud to fight and defend healthcare reform, climate change solutions, job training for our veterans, and college affordability. When I was at the top of the ticket in 2010, I defended my progressive record in a deep-red part of the state, turned out the base and won independents, and outperformed the national Democratic brand by ten points. I will bring that same inexhaustible spirit and abiding commitment to progressive values to this race. And when we communicate our values and vision, Virginians rise up in support. Primaries Make Us Stronger Primaries make parties stronger when we elevate debate, build our grassroots game and energize our team. Primaries divide us ONLY when we choose for them to do so. That is why I pledge to focus on a positive, progressive campaign of ideas. Knowing what a statesman Ralph Northam has always been, I see no reason we cannot compete for your votes while remaining united in our values and commitment for keeping Virginia blue in November. With Tim Kaine as Vice President and perhaps Bobby Scott as a sitting Senator on the ballot, I saw a strong path to victory for our statewide ticket this November. Now, given what happened in November, I believe we need bold, new-generation leadership at the top of the ticket to energize, unite, and inspire voters at a time when so much of what we fought for stands at risk.

First, check out the glaring disparity in outcomes of bills sponsored by Republicans and by Democrats. Incredible. In contrast, basically every piece of consequential or major legislation introduced by Democrats was killed by Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates. Still very bad, but not as horrendous as the House of Delegates.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Bill Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Both candidates emphasize kitchen-table issues such as economic development and education. But sharp ideological differences were on display last week as they appeared at a candidate forum. Sturtevant emphasized the need to reduce tax and regulatory burdens on businesses. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

News4's Tom Sherwood reports. Not that you'd necessarily know that. This is a low-key election. There aren't a lot of competitive races, and it's an off-year for politics -- all of which could lead to low turnout. But this election matters -- possibly more than you think it does. So here are four things you need to know about the Nov. 3 election. Some basics: Polls will be open from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. Click here to find your polling location. Voters in Virginia are required to show a photo ID to vote, but that ID does not have to show the voter's address. 1. Voters Could Shift Balance of Power in Va. Senate While Republicans are expected to maintain control in the House of Delegates, the Democrats only need to pick up one seat to gain control of the Senate. Right now, Republicans have 21 seats to the Democrats' 19. Democrats believe they will pick up a seat in the Richmond area, where Chesterfield Supervisor Dan Gecker (D) faces Glen Sturtevant (R). But District 29 in Prince William County is also considered a competitive race. If Democratic candidate Jeremy McPike wins the seat, the Democrats could regain control. If both parties end up with 20 seats, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) will cast the tie-breaking vote. 2. Many Voters Won't See Very Many Choices on Their Ballot While there are some competitive races, many voters will not see many options on their ballot. In the state Senate, 22 out of 40 races have more than one candidate, but only six are expected to be close. In the House, only 38 out of 100 have two or more candidates, with only a handful expected to be competitive. The chief architect of the 2011 Republican legislative redistricting plan testified in federal court earlier this year that raw political self-interest was at work when the maps were being drawn. Del. S. Chris Jones testified that he tried to accommodate requests from 75 to 80 delegates who sought to tweak lines, sometimes to draw out precincts where they had historically performed poorly or to draw out a potential primary challenger. But those requests were made by Republicans and Democrats alike, and GOP lawmakers dispute that the current map is squelching competition. 3. Low Voter Turnout Means Every Vote Counts Low voter turnout has led to some surprising upsets in years past. Last year, Eric Cantor's defeat to Tea Party candidate Dave Brat cost the number two House Republican his seat in Congress and left the political world in shock. Locally, Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille blamed low turnout when he lost the Democratic mayoral primary to councilmember Allison Silberberg. Silberberg won by just over 300 votes. Euille has been mayor since 2003, and had never been opposed prior to this summer. There's no Republican candidate on the ballot. from loading. All rights reserved."}

Virginia Politics How To Deal With the Voter Photo ID Requirement Dan Sullivan - July 9, 2014 5 I have warned that implementation of the new Virginia photo Voter ID requirement is mercurial. If it is not in black and white in the statute, then Mark Obenshain's position is that only he, as the sponsor, can interpret the law's intent. This promises further obfuscation and confusion through November. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Virginia (DPVA) is twiddling its thumbs and whistling Dixie as it walks down a treacherous path to voter suppression. That is NOT the way to deal with this. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is certain at the Virginia Department of Elections (VADE), nee State Board of Elections. There will be an opportunity through a comment period on the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall for the voter ID regulations beginning on or about the 14th of July. I don't see anything posted yet. - state Senator Mark Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg) This is the tip of the iceberg. The Registrars, as best I can tell, all have the equipment and software required to issue the new, otherwise useless, photo IDs. No voter, as far as I can tell, has obtained a new voter ID. The DPVA plan to facilitate obtaining IDs is completely dependent upon the rules remaining in stasis. That is pure folly. There are so many assumptions about implementation and no branch plans to compensate for failures of those assumptions. I have the solution, but first a bit of discussion. Election night, we might not have a window on Virginia results. There has been a transition to a new user interface across state agencies. Not uncommon are the sort of errors you find on the General Assembly pages or even on the SBE site. Some things are just too coincidental to be coincidence. For now some of the links on the Results and Reports user interface function only after insistent manipulation. Some don't seem to function at all. We are currentlly (sic) in the process of converting our results from our former system to this system. If you would like to view results in the meantime, please go to our Results page. If not, you know you have a potential fraud by that voter. I'm concerned that we have very good free honest elections in Virginia. He said there are still about two weeks left in the process of reviewing those not accepted including the voter ID bill."}

But why she moved 83 voters from one Virginia House of Delegates district to another, no one seems to know. Former Fredericksburg registrar Juanita Pitchford cannot say. She died in April. But the adjustments she made in the 28th and 88th districts live on, throwing two House seats and control of the entire chamber into highly litigated limbo nearly three weeks after Election Day. Precisely 83 voters were initially said to have been moved out of a district won by a margin of 82 votes, although after a few days' investigation, election officials said they had uncovered hundreds of misassigned voters between the two districts. They say 147 of them voted in the wrong district. Perhaps adding to the confusion: The 28th and the 88th races each had a candidate with the last name Cole, one a Democrat, the other a Republican. It would all be one big knee-slapper if the stakes weren't so high. Control of the state's lower chamber hangs in the balance. Republicans boasted a 66-to-34 majority going into this month's elections. Now the count is 49 Democrats and 51 Republicans, including the two uncertified races. If those two delegates are not seated, the parties would be tied at 49 apiece. Voter confidence could be especially tested if a losing candidate files a challenge with the state legislature, with the winner decided by a House vote, observers say. An election challenge in the legislature would be a rare but not unprecedented means of settling a Virginia General Assembly race. Democrats and their allies have filed three lawsuits to try to block the State Board of Elections from certifying the 28th and 88th District races. Two of the suits were promptly dismissed. In the third case, a federal judge rejected Democrats' request for a temporary restraining order to block the state board from certifying the 28th District election when it meets Monday. But he left open the possibility of a special election. At that hearing in federal court, state officials said, they had discovered a total of 384 misassigned voters between the two House districts. But over the weekend, state elections officials indicated that 147 of the misassigned voters cast ballots. Elections officials said the trouble began on Charles Street, in a heavily Democratic precinct where in 2016, 68 percent voters went for Hillary Clinton and 27 percent went for President Trump. The whole street should be in the 28th District. He was at a loss to explain why. There has been some pushback on the rogue registrar theory, with several people suggesting Pitchford could not have acted alone. Her daughter, Aliya Wong, said the registrar had plenty of supervision. In the 88th District, Del. But if Mark Cole's race remains uncertified, and he is not seated when the legislature convenes in January, Democrats could use the vacancy to help them gain control of a chamber that the GOP has long dominated. Democrats could take power if recounts produce a win in two other close races. Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) has a 106-vote lead over Democrat Donte Tanner, while Del. David E. Yancey (R-Newport News) is up just 10 votes over Democrat Shelly Simonds. A losing candidate could contest the results in the House, something Saslaw, one of Virginia's longest-serving legislators, recalls happening just once before. In 1979, Republican Meyera Oberndorf challenged her loss in a Senate race, which she blamed on malfunctioning voting machines. With the Senate under Democratic control, she got nowhere.

Astrid Riecken Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Gregory S. Schneider , Reporter Laura Vozzella , Reporter Fenit Nirappil , Reporter November 8, 2017 Democrat Ralph Shearer Northam won a hard-fought race to become Virginia's 73rd governor, beating Republican Ed Gillespie in an election watched around the nation as a judgment on President Trump and the politics of polarization. Voters chose Northam, the lieutenant governor, 54 percent to 45 percent over Gillespie as part of a stunning Democratic sweep of statewide offices, including lieutenant governor and attorney general. There also were widespread Democratic victories in the House of Delegates. The vote had national resonance as well. Gillespie, in turn, had dipped into Trump's playbook with strong law-and-order messages, but tried to keep his distance from the president in a state that now leans blue. Social media reaction Wednesday framed the Virginia governor's contest as a bellwether of the sentiments across the country, as some people predicted it was also a sign that the GOP faces big trouble ahead. Many voters said they were simply relieved that the election and its ads were over. Democrats at the Northam campaign party in Fairfax City broke into tears as results came in Tuesday evening, the outcome beyond what most had dared hope. For all the fury unleashed on the Virginia races by Trump and his followers, who lit up social media and tried to define the contests in terms of Confederate statues and Hispanic street gangs, Northam had seemed an unlikely standard-bearer to fight back. Even some fellow Democrats had criticized Northam for his low-key campaign style. But in the end, he won more votes than any previous Virginia governor, and it was a historic night for the party across many fronts. Voters energized by last fall's demoralizing loss by Hillary Clinton came out in large numbers to elect Democrat Justin Fairfax as lieutenant governor over Republican state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Fauquier), making Fairfax the first African American elected to a statewide office in Virginia since L. Douglas Wilder won as governor in 1989. Democratic Attorney General Mark R. Herring was reelected over Republican challenger John Adams. And Democrats were poised to pick up at least 14 seats in the House of Delegates after fielding a historic number of challengers, many of them women. Among them is Danica Roem, who defeated longtime Republican incumbent Robert G. Marshall in Prince William County to become the first openly transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature. Six more House seats were in play as of late Tuesday, with four of those headed for recounts. The Democrats needed to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the House of Delegates. That would be a stunning turnaround in a body where Republicans had a seemingly insurmountable 66-to-34 advantage. All 100 seats were up for election. Whether you voted for me or not, we are all Virginians. As he has traveled the country, McAuliffe said, the pressure from other Democrats to perform in this election has been enormous. The victors basked in the idea that they had just shown something to the nation. Gillespie, 56, was gracious in defeat, taking to the stage at a hotel outside Richmond to congratulate Northam and pledging to help the new governor in any way he could. Gillespie never mentioned Trump during his concession speech, just as he almost never mentioned him on the campaign trail. But the president was quick to lash out earlier Tuesday as it became clear that Gillespie was losing. He was referring to the MS-13 street gang, which featured prominently in Gillespie ads raising fears of violence and illegal immigration. Preliminary exit poll results found 28 percent of voters identifying as liberals, up eight points from the 2013 governor's race and two points from last year, when Clinton won the state by five points. Democrats composed 41 percent of the electorate, up four points from 2013 and one point from last year. Republicans were 31 percent of the electorate, a record low in exit polling dating to 1996. African Americans accounted for 21 percent of voters, according to exit poll results, identical to their share in last year's presidential election and one point higher than in 2013. In total, nonwhite voters made up 33 percent of the electorate, the same as last year but up from 28 percent in the previous governor's race. Black voters favored Northam over Gillespie by a 73-point margin, while Hispanic voters favored Northam by 33 points. Democrats had worked feverishly in recent weeks to court African American voters, and former president Barack Obama held a rally with the ticket in Richmond last month. Obama also recorded a robo-call that went out Monday and Tuesday to encourage people to vote. As the national Democratic Party has wrestled with fractures in recent weeks, the Virginia party may have offered a lesson in how to move ahead. After former congressman Tom Perriello mounted a progressive challenge to Northam for the Democratic nomination and lost, he became a foot soldier for Northam in the general election. Northam also may have benefited from the historic number of Democrats who challenged Republican incumbents in House of Delegates races. Their presence on the ballot helped bring out voters in districts all over the state who otherwise might have had little interest in a nonpresidential election. Republicans, on the other hand, failed for most of the year to project the same kind of unity. Gillespie ran a restrained primary race and nearly lost to rival Corey Stewart, who fully embraced Trumpian bombast and made defending Confederate statues and fighting illegal immigration into central issues. After the primary, Stewart refused to endorse Gillespie unless the candidate adopted his hard-right agenda and style. Gillespie gradually leaned in that direction as it became clear that he needed to firm up his base, especially in rural areas, but Stewart never campaigned for him. The governor's race had been close in pre-election polling, and Northam had been criticized by some in his party for waging a subdued campaign at a time of high passion and sharp rhetoric. But Virginians turned out in large numbers on a day of patchy rain around the state as Northam and the Democrats relied on an increasingly efficient system for getting voters to the polls, especially in the more-populous parts of the state. Gillespie ultimately failed in his attempt to walk a very fine line, working for votes in a state where his party's president is deeply unpopular. But Gillespie made a late turn toward Trumpian tactics that seemed to energize his campaign, promising to defend Confederate heritage and airing ads that seemed to equate illegal immigrants with violent gangs. The Trump factor drove an unusual amount of national attention toward Virginia, whose election was one of only two statewide contests in the country. The other, in New Jersey, was not considered competitive, so Virginia became the proxy for the painful efforts by both major parties to find their way forward in the age of Trump.

On the ballot, Virginia's election was about the state's future and who would assume a slew of elective offices, from governor to attorney general to seats in the House of Delegates. Yet a year after Trump won the White House, voters in Virginia said in post-election interviews that their choices were shaped more by their attitude toward the president than any candidate close to home. Ask them to identify an issue championed by Gov.-elect Ralph Northam (D), and they may fumble for an answer. Ask them the name of the man who was elected lieutenant governor and they might have to think for a moment. Ask them to identify who they chose for the House of Delegates, and they were likely to reply with a blank stare. But ask them why they voted Democratic, and their answers were precise and infused with anger. Her husband, Mike Potts, 51, a software process engineer, regards himself as a fiscal conservative and a loyal Republican who researches candidates before voting. But he chose only Democrats on Tuesday, and said he didn't need to study the candidates' biographies or positions. The fact that they weren't Republicans was all he needed to know. The Republicans aren't giving us any. I'm protesting and it feels good in the sense that I'm registering my concerns about it. His sentiment was shared by Democrats, who said they were focused more on who they were opposing than who they were supporting. But in this case, no. Northam is a soft-spoken man who twice voted for President George W. Bush and was little known before his bid to succeed Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). Yet the governor-elect was the recipient of more votes than any candidate in the commonwealth's history of gubernatorial campaigns, and he got more votes than any Virginia Democrat in the past 32 years. But Connolly said Democratic victories in the legislative races, as well as the top statewide contests, represent a consolidation of Democratic power, particularly in Northern Virginia, where Republicans were trounced. But it wasn't a mindless reaction to Trump. Not in all cases. Even if they reject Trump, several voters said they remain open to Republican candidates. It's his personality, not what he's doing. Paul Gallagher, 51, a consultant who lives in Lorton, also voted for Gillespie even though he dislikes Trump. Gallagher, who prefers to support candidates on a case-by-case basis, said that the 2016 presidential election was when he used his vote to send a message. He rejected Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton and supported Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Martin Andrews, 66, a retired contracting purchaser who lives in Fairfax Station, said he voted for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, but said he used his vote for Northam to convey his unhappiness with how Trump comports himself. Dave Hughes, 59, a Web designer who lives in Springfield, said he was more focused on Washington than Virginia as he voted for Northam on Tuesday. That neither Northam nor Gillespie impressed him was of no significance, he said. Sitting with her cup of soup inside the Panera, Sandra Kilburn, a retired pediatric physical therapist, recounted having voted for George H.W. Bush and other Republicans.

Sturtevant won the 10th District seat after benefiting from a huge turnout in conservative Powhatan County, which analysts attributed in part to the gun issue. McAuliffe had backed Gecker as far back as the Democratic primary and has broken with typical past Democratic practice in Virginia by openly opposing the National Rifle Association. He and others also said that hotly contested local races, such as for sheriff and county supervisor, had boosted turnout in Powhatan. McAuliffe stayed out of the spotlight Wednesday, and his spokesman directed questions about the election to the state Democratic organization. He gambled big and lost in what was supposed to be his specialty: raising money and overseeing campaigns. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said. Instead, McAuliffe will have to settle for having a place in history mainly as a star salesman for Virginia who cut deals to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, according to politicians of both parties and independent analysts. That is an accomplishment that even Republicans welcome, but there is a caveat. Virginia gained 32,000 jobs in the 12 months ending in September, a gain of 0.9 percent, according to federal data. The percentage gain was 37th among the states and the District. Even had his party won control of the Senate, McAuliffe would have faced an effective veto in the House, where Republicans retained their large majority. But control of the Senate would have given McAuliffe more leverage. McAuliffe can realistically hope to make progress in the next session on increasing spending for K-12 education. But that is not a heavy lift. Republicans are not averse to the idea because the economic recovery has generated enough extra revenue that a tax increase would not be necessary. In defending his record in the campaign, McAuliffe can point to significant challenges that hampered his effort. The Democrats always face difficulty in off-year elections because their supporters are less likely to show up than Republicans. In addition, as GOP victories in other states demonstrated, Republicans were generally more energized this year, partly because of all the attention paid to the high-profile presidential contest. Still, McAuliffe chose to invest substantial personal political capital in the race. He raised millions of dollars, helping to make it the costliest legislative campaign in Virginia history. He brought in dozens of campaign operatives to identify potential supporters and get them to the polls and barnstormed all over the state, getting hoarse in the process. Democrats said they welcomed the support, even if it fell short. All that infrastructure will help McAuliffe aim for a better showing in a high-profile political context next year.

Change has been coming to the increasingly diverse state for years, but the evolution was turbocharged by the provocative influence of Donald Trump. Democrat Ralph Northam won the governor's race over Republican Ed Gillespie by a comfortable nine-point margin, but Farnsworth said the outcome could have been much tighter if not for highly motivated anti-Trump voters. That was particularly evident in the state's suburban regions, where Northam racked up wide margins and Democratic challengers unseated Republican incumbents in the House of Delegates. The sentiment turned up in voices across the state. It was in eastern Henrico County outside Richmond, where a few days before the election Nick Hall was all set to vote for the Democrat for governor even though he wasn't sure of his name. Hall just wanted to strike back at the party of Trump. In exit polling, more than a third of voters said they came out to the polls to express opposition to Trump. Half that many said they voted to support Trump. View Graphic Virginia general election guide An especially striking aspect of that anti-Trump fervor was that most of those new candidates he inspired were women. Of the 15 Democrats who were on track to flip Republican seats in the House of Delegates, 11 were women. All of the delegates they will replace are men. There were only 17 women among the 100 members of the House of Delegates in its most recent session. The election stunned both sides. Northam drew ire from fellow Democrats just a few weeks ago, when he told Cox during a moment of bonhomie that he looked forward to working with him as speaker. That role is in question now as Democrats appear headed for at least a 50-50 split in the House, pending the resolution of a handful of close races. The president whipped Democrats into a frenzy, Albo said. He said it's not accurate to call Virginia more Democratic in the wake of the election. But rural red areas went for Gillespie in great numbers, sometimes even more than for Trump last year. And the Democratic Party itself, for all its huge gains, is going to have serious issues to resolve. What's more, it was Stanfield's group that came up with the anti-Dominion pledge signed by so many of the new candidates. Other Democrats, including Northam, have taken large contributions from Dominion, the state's largest corporate political donor, and favor the controversial natural gas pipeline it is building in rural parts of the state. The new Democratic wave could lead to chaos. It was an anachronistic reference at a time when the state seems to have put on a fresh face. But there's something else that might still limit the pace of change. Rachel Chason, Jenna Portnoy and Scott Clement contributed to this report. Comments The story must be told.

The district Comstock represents is notoriously independent, swinging back and forth in the past few elections. Republicans have only a slight edge, and in a hotly contested presidential race, Democrats can overcome it. Turnout in midterm elections favors Republicans; in a presidential year, Democrats do better. Virginia will be a key battleground for both parties next year. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, is already recruiting volunteers in the state. She also has assembled a campaign team with many ties to the commonwealth. Two Republicans are retiring in Democratic-leaning state House districts in the area; so is a longtime Democratic state senator. If 2016 is a better opportunity for Democrats, it might also be their last unless future redistricting changes the lines. The longer Comstock spends in office, the stronger her ties will grow to a district that values constituent service over partisan identification. Federal workers and contractors made up a large proportion of the population; so do immigrants. In 2008, voters there narrowly supported President Obama; four years later they supported Mitt Romney. Comstock is following the model that made Wolf impossible for Democrats to unseat despite an increasingly amenable electorate. On pay for federal employees and funding for regional transportation, she has bucked her party. She voted against all three Republican budget proposals earlier this year, saying they were too cruel to federal workers. Democrats counter that Comstock far more often votes with Republicans, including this week for a late-term abortion ban and against allowing young illegal immigrants to serve in the armed forces. Wolf was just as conservative on abortion and immigration. His appeal lay in his clout and commitment when it came to regional concerns. A savvy and inexhaustible campaigner, Comstock is trying to cultivate the same loyalty, even though she lacks the seniority her predecessor held. Several Democrats have named two possible recruits they see as strong: Shenandoah University professor Karen Schultz, who came close to winning an expensive state Senate race in 2007, and Cate Wyatt, a former state secretary of commerce who now works on historic preservation. Also mentioned are state Sen. Jennifer T. Wexton and state Rep. Kathleen Murphy, though both say they are focused on winning reelection this fall. Democrats had hoped for a competitive race in this narrowly Republican district in 2014, when Wolf retired after three decades in office. Instead, they suffered a disastrous loss. Both sides say that Fairfax County Supervisor John W. Foust was mortally wounded by a clumsy comment he made a few months before the election.

That is partly why both parties see an opening in those races, despite the fact that the districts have gone blue in recent statewide races. All 140 General Assembly seats are up for election in November. Democrats only have to pick up one seat to take control of the upper chamber because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Only a handful of Senate seats are being hotly contested, with the Colgan and Watkins seats widely seen as most up for grabs. But Republicans see an opportunity in a district that has long supported Colgan, a Catholic who opposes abortion and crossed party lines to help Republicans pass the 2012 budget. Colgan, who is retiring after four decades, is a former World War II pilot and founder of the regional airline Colgan Air. Parrish, an Air Force veteran and the owner of Manassas Ice and Fuel, hopes to follow his late father to the General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Finance Committee in 2004, the elder Parrish was one of the Republicans who helped then-Gov. The legislative victory catapulted the Democrat to national prominence and divided the GOP, which still bears the scars of the deal at a time when compromise is a dirty word among hard-core conservatives. Parrish says he probably would have voted the same way. Parrish said he was most proud of getting Baldwin Elementary School built, even though the project required a tax increase. McPike, a Dale City volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, has played up some liberal causes, such as abortion rights, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But like Parrish, McPike has emphasized bread-and-butter issues such as transportation and education in the suburban district. McPike hopes TV commercials showing him stuck in traffic behind the wheel of his Hyundai Santa Fe will connect with voters frustrated by long commutes into Washington. Hoofing it around a subdivision in the rain one evening last week, McPike handed out business cards with his personal cellphone number and looked for common ground among young families with children like his. He spoke of reforming standardized tests, which he said can be overwhelming for students. Both parties are flooding the districts with cash. Even more money has poured into the race to succeed Watkins. The territory they seek to represent is Virginia in miniature: capable of swinging, but not because it is full of middle-of-the-road voters. In between are Republican-leaning chunks of suburban Chesterfield. The district includes larger swaths of the city than when Watkins first took office in 1998, so overall it tilts blue in statewide races. Warner won it, as did McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. As the district changed, Watkins held on by dint of personal popularity and moderate voting record. He was one of just three Senate Republicans to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Watkins is a nurseryman and chairman of Essex Bank who served in the House for 16 years before joining the Senate. The two men vying to succeed him say they would follow in his moderate, pro-business footsteps. In some ways, both play against partisan type. (He and his wife are white and have three young adopted children. The Democrat, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is an lawyer-turned-developer who once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Bill Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Both candidates emphasize kitchen-table issues such as economic development and education. But sharp ideological differences were on display last week as they appeared at a candidate forum. Sturtevant emphasized the need to reduce tax and regulatory burdens on businesses. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

It may seem as exciting as a lump of coal, but the Republican gerrymander in the House of Delegates gets a lot of attention from thankful Virginia Democrats. Because these district lines have become the perfect excuse for the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad performance of House Democrats in 2013. I am not a fan of the use of the gerrymander as a crutch, but in the spirit of Christmas I will concede that it is a contributing factor to the difficulties of House Democrats. But a comparison with their peers in the State Senate also shows deeper concerns for Virginia Democrats. There are two more marginally Obama districts held by Republicans (7th, Wagner; and 10th, Watkins), and another one won by Tim Kaine (17th, Reeves). Senate Democrats had no way of knowing how the 2012 election would end up, so we should look at 2008. They then had a handful of marginal districts (10th, Watkins; 17th, Reeves; 13th, Black; 20th, Stanley; and 7th, Wagner). Democrats tried with their first map (drawing a safely Democratic 8th District in the Richmond area, and a more competitive 7th in Virginia Beach), but that got shot down as too partisan by Governor Bob McDonnell. That map probably would have created 21 safely Democratic seats, plus any upside from keeping around Puckett, Houck, and Reynolds. If only that has passed. There are only two Republican delegates representing districts that are this Democratic in 2012: Rust (86th) and Ramadan (87th). The 2nd district in Prince William is a good district for Democrats to analyze for the future. The former have been screwed in redistricting, but both have failed to find ways to win in less than overwhelmingly Democratic districts. Right now, Republicans in the General Assembly simply outcompete and outperform their Democratic opponents among the narrow sliver of swing voters in most competitive districts.

Low 73F. Winds WSW at 10 to 15 mph. At stake is the political power to set legislative initiatives, and, for Democrats, to force Republicans, who have a 2-to-1 advantage in the House of Delegates, to the bargaining table. But political experts say even if Democrats retake the Senate, it won't greatly change the state's legislative landscape given the Republican dominance in the House. Winning the Senate might give McAuliffe a platform to show off his political prowess in anticipation of the presidential election next year, but it likely wouldn't help him push through the bills most important to him, they say. Voter turnout for state legislative elections is generally around 30 percent or less. In addition, many candidates are running unopposed. That can make it hard for voters to get excited about the election. McAuliffe, nearly midway through his four-year term and prohibited from running for re-election, will soon send lawmakers a two-year state budget that will highlight his priorities. But the Republican-controlled House can stop much of a Democratic agenda, even if Democrats take back the Senate. Democrats need to win just one additional Senate seat to effectively control the chamber because Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam votes to break ties on all legislation except budget issues. Longtime state political analyst Bob Holsworth agreed that even a Democratic Senate wouldn't change the dynamic of Virginia politics. All 100 seats in the House and all 40 in the Senate are up for election, but most races don't have more than one candidate on the ballot. In the House, 38 races have more than one candidate. In the Senate, 23 races have multiple candidates. In Hampton Roads, Sen. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Sen. Kenny Alexander, D-Norfolk, will be re-elected without challengers. One of the few competitive races here is Democrat Gary McCollum's attempt to unseat Republican Sen. Frank Wagner in the 7th District, which encompasses parts of Virginia Beach and Norfolk. Gun control, Medicaid expansion and abortion rights are issues in a number of races. In other parts of the state, politicos are especially watching a handful of races. In the Prince William County area, Manassas Mayor Hal Parrish, a Republican, and Alexandria government employee Jeremy McPike, a Democrat, are vying to replace retiring moderate Democratic Sen. Chuck Colgan in the 29th District. Colgan hasn't endorsed either candidate, but his family is backing longtime friend Parrish. In the Richmond area's 10th District, Democrat Dan Gecker is facing Republican Glen Sturtevant for the seat being vacated by retiring moderate Republican Sen. John Watkins. Besides the McCollum-Wagner race, another Hampton Roads Senate district that could be close is the 6th, which includes the Eastern Shore and part of Norfolk. Democratic Sen. Lynwood Lewis is facing a challenge from Republican attorney Richard Ottinger there, and each side has unloaded attacks on the opponent over taxes. Lewis won a special election for the seat by just 11 votes last year. In the Roanoke area, Democratic Sen. John Edwards faces a challenge from Republican Nancy Dye and independent candidate Don Caldwell, the city's commonwealth's attorney. McAuliffe campaigned for candidates Saturday and is scheduled to campaign today for Gecker, Edwards, McPike, McCollum, Lewis and Jill McCabe, who is challenging Loudoun County Republican Sen. Dick Black. Holsworth and Quentin Kidd, a Christopher Newport University political science professor, said the other factor that could affect the election is Donald Trump. The Republican Party is engrossed in a spirited presidential primary, and its base is active and paying attention, while Clinton is the presumed Democratic nominee next year. That could boost GOP turnout on Tuesday, they said. Kidd said he thinks there's a 50-50 chance the Democrats will retake the Senate. Your notification has been saved.

At least that's how it's supposed to work, but here in Virginia we've allowed... Augusta now has nine possible ACP routes, and Dominion has added one alternate route in Buckingham County. Holding an Open House in Nelson for all three counties is a first, especially since we were told by Dominion representatives they didn't have to hold it all. Suffice it to say, the anti-pipeline booths set up outside the venue were very busy. Most people were joining Nelson's anti-pipeline groups, buying No Pipeline signs and t-shirts, and asking how they could help with the resistance. Free Nelson organized a protest for the event, centered around Dominion's purchase of Virginia's elected officials. On February 5, about 50 citizen lobbyists attended the General Assembly session to lobby for the repeal of the survey without permission law passed in 2004. They lobbied Virginia's Senators in the morning and attended the Commerce and Labor Committee meeting where the bill was promptly killed without a motion. Governor McAuliffe and Senator Warner were included in the protest, because McAuliffe supports the proposed ACP, and then-Governor Warner signed the 2004 survey bill into law. SB1166 was referred to a committee studying the FOIA statute. About 50 landowners and community activists (some who brought teenage children) from Nelson, Buckingham, and Augusta Counties made the trek to Richmond Monday morning to lobby all 40 senators regarding SB 1338, which would repeal a law Senator Frank Wagner introduced in 2004, known as the Wagner Act. The citizen lobbyists had previously set up morning appointments with legislators. When they arrived, they broke up into eight groups to ensure contact and discussion with each Senator. They ate lunch and then made their way to Senate Room B where the hearing was scheduled to begin at 1 pm. After a lengthy two-plus-hour delay because the Senators were in session in the Capitol, the hearing finally began. Senators continued to saunter in after the hearing had been gaveled into session by Chair Senator John Watkins. Energy and Environment Your 2015 legislative session cheat sheet: Clean energy bills ivymain - January 21, 2015 0 I'm starting my review of 2015 energy legislation with a look at bills dealing with renewable energy and energy efficiency. Most of these bills will be heard in the committees on Commerce and Labor, though bills that cost money (tax credits and grants) usually go to Finance. Bills referred to Senate Commerce and Labor are heard by the full committee, which meets on Monday afternoons. It consists of 14 members: 11 Republicans and 3 Democrats. The House bills are typically assigned to the 13-member Special Subcommittee on Energy (10 Republicans and 3 Democrats, no fixed schedule, but we've heard February 3d is the likely date). Bills that do not meet the approval of Dominion Power can expect a quick death here on an unrecorded voice vote, never to be heard from again. But on the plus side, the meetings are often quite lively, like old-fashioned hangings. Net metering bills Net metering is the policy that allows owners of solar (or other renewable) energy systems to be credited for the excess power they feed back into the grid when the systems produce a surplus; the owners use the credits when their systems aren't supplying power and they need to draw electricity from the grid. Virginia law restricts who can use net metering, and how much. Expanding net metering is a major goal of renewable energy advocates, who argue it offers a free market approach to growth-give customers the freedom to build solar projects, get the utility out of the way, and solar will thrive. The Winchester Star reports that the 20-megawatt array-100,000 solar panels, capable of powering 20,000 homes-had been planned for 145 acres of agricultural land in Clarke County. This shouldn't surprise anyone. Virginia has done little to encourage our utilities to buy solar power, and so for the most part they haven't. The state's voluntary renewable energy goal is a sorry dishrag of a law. It can be-and is-met with old, out-of-state hydro plants, trash burning, and wood. And because our utilities have a state-sanctioned monopoly on power sales, customers who want solar power can't go buy it from someone else. But if it isn't surprising for Virginia to lose a big solar opportunity due to utility intransigence, it is stupid. Virginia consumers would love to buy solar energy, local governments would love to have solar farms generating tax revenue, and local businesses would love to create solar jobs. A win-win-win opportunity is being wasted, at a time when lawmakers complain about how hard it is to reduce our carbon emissions. Even Dominion says it wants utility-scale solar (eventually), but it wants to build its own so it can earn the fat return on equity guaranteed to it by Virginia law. Last year the General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill to support solar development, and then failed to fund it. Governor McAuliffe's energy plan talks a good game on solar, but it's toothless. We will continue to miss out on opportunities like this one until we have a law that requires Virginia utilities to buy solar, or lets consumers contract for it directly from any willing seller."}

Dick Howard is not among them. Howard is the University of Virginia law professor who in 1996 wrote a legal opinion saying the lieutenant governor has the power to cast a tie-breaking vote on anything before the Senate. Howard stands by his 15-year-old legal opinion. But in an interview Monday, he described it not as legal gospel so much as a very educated guess. A legal scholar who was chief draftsman of the state constitution when it was revamped in 1971, Howard was tapped to help the Senate organize itself in 1996, the only other time the chamber was evenly split. The lieutenant governor has, by custom and tradition, always cast the tie-breaking vote on ordinary legislation, Howard said. But Howard said he later concluded that the lieutenant governor had unlimited voting authority. That debate could move to court now that Democrats are threatening to sue the GOP for the right to share control. The party announced its intention on Monday but declined to say when it plans to file the suit, what court it will file in or even disclose its attorney. The dispute leaves control of the chamber in doubt less than two months before the General Assembly returns in January for its 60-day session. But Sen. Ryan T. McDougle (Hanover), chairman of the Republican caucus, said a judge cannot wade into the issue because of the separation of powers between branches of government. Democrats, who had 20 senators and the lieutenant governor, intended to rely on it to control the chamber. But Sen. Virgil H. Goode Jr., a Democrat who later switched parties while serving in Congress, would not agree to the reorganization unless Republicans shared power in the chamber. The two parties shared control for four years. But he said he does not know whether he can vote on the budget, tax bills, bonds, constitutional amendments and judges. His staff indicated last week that it thought he could, but Bolling said Monday that he is doing more research. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) has been asked for a legal opinion, his office confirmed Monday, but a spokesman declined to comment.

He will face Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam in a November clash that may test how much of a burden President Trump is among moderate voters, who are deeply contemptuous of the president. With all precincts reporting on Wednesday, Mr. Gillespie had a lead of about 4,300 votes, or about 1.2 percentage points, over Corey Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors. It was a deeply embarrassing night for Mr. Gillespie, who greatly outspent Mr. Stewart and entered the primary with significant name recognition after barely losing a challenge to Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, three years ago. But the threat roused Mr. Northam, 57, a mild-mannered physician. And he effectively harnessed the support of every statewide elected Democrat, won a handful of other influential endorsements and spent millions on television ads to repel Mr. Perriello. Mr. Northam begins the general election with an advantage in large part because of Mr. Trump. Nearly 60 percent of Virginia independents disapprove of Mr. Trump, according to a Washington Post poll last month. Virginia is increasingly diverse, especially in its vote-rich urban crescent from the Washington suburbs to Hampton Roads, and it has been drifting away from Republicans, who have not won a statewide election here since 2009. Mr. Trump has further widened the political gulf in a state that was already culturally cleaved among Appalachia, the traditional South and the fast-growing Middle Atlantic. Mr. Gillespie will have to try to forge a delicate coalition that melds pro-Trump rural conservatives with anti-Trump suburbanites. Image Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, appeared with Gov. Terry McAuliffe, in Crystal City, Va., on Tuesday. In fact, he said earlier this year that he had voted twice for former President George W. Bush, for whom Mr. Gillespie worked in the White House. Democrats here are plainly energized about sending a message to Mr. Trump: Turnout spiked from the last time they had a contested primary for governor and was substantially higher than in the Republican race. After Mr. Perriello, 42, entered the race with slashing speeches against the president, Mr. Northam saw how voters were responding and began speaking out more fiercely.

Politics In tight Virginia races, Democrats cutting ties to Obama By Anita Kumar October 17, 2011 ROCKY MOUNT, Va. Less than a month before critical legislative elections, several Democratic legislators say they have reservations about the president and will not commit to supporting him next year. At least one longtime state senator has announced he will not vote for Obama in 2012. House Minority Leader Ward L. Armstrong (D), who is fighting for reelection after Republicans eliminated his district during redistricting, released a TV ad in response to an attempt by his Republican opponent, Del. Charles D. Poindexter, to tie him to Obama in the Southside district. In the ad, Armstrong dismisses the notion. Recent polls and interviews with voters show that Republicans may have had some success. In 2008, Obama became the first Democratic president to carry Virginia in more than four decades, leading some Democrats to declare the state blue. Virginia is expected to remain a swing state. Even Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who barely won reelection last year, said in August that Obama would not win Virginia if the election were held now. The White House had considered stops in Danville, Newport News, Charlottesville and Fredericksburg. Instead, Obama will speak at a high school in Emporia on Tuesday, and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton and a fire station in Chesterfield County outside Richmond on Wednesday. He will be joined by first lady Michelle Obama in Hampton. Democratic legislators say they constantly hear from residents who are frustrated that Washington fails to get things done. State Sen. George L. Barker (D-Fairfax), who is in danger of losing his seat, said Republicans who supported him in 2007 have told him they will not vote for him because of Obama. Next year, when Obama is at the top of the ticket, many Democrats will have to embrace him, knowing their fates are intertwined. Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell), who faces a tough reelection battle in Southwest against Republican Adam Light, became the first Democratic legislator in the state to say he would not be supporting Obama in 2012. Puckett made his comments last month after Republicans put up billboards in his rural district showing him campaigning for Obama in 2008. In an interview with The Washington Post, Armstrong declined to say whether he would support Obama next year. Sen. William Roscoe Reynolds (D-Franklin), Sen. R. Edward Houck (D- Spotsylvania), Barker and Puller also declined to say if they would vote for Obama next year.

Democrat Janet Howell accused a minority of the Senate of delaying and obstructing action. Related Stories Virginia leaders propose spending plan that expands Medicaid Virginia Virginia senate leader: No shutdown over Medicaid Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox, a Republican who backs Medicaid expansion, canceled a planned House meeting for Wednesday, since the delegates would have had no new bill to vote on. The House passed its budget in this special session more than a month ago and had expected to act Wednesday on a Senate version. Republicans are currently split on whether to expand Medicaid after years of near unified opposition. The disagreement has led to a stalemate on the state budget. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who made Medicaid expansion to about 300,000 more low-income Virignians part of his campaign last year, was even stronger. Pro-expansion lawmakers have a majority in both chambers, but some Republican Senate leaders oppose Medicaid expansion and said they need more time to study a new budget deal released Monday by pro-expansion Republicans. Sen. Emmett Hanger, Republican co-chair of the Finance Committee, had apparently been prepared to join Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw Tuesday to bypass the Finance Committee and get the budget bill to the floor. Instead, Norment assured pro-expansion lawmakers that the Senate would finally hold a vote on its budget next week. He maintains his opposition to Medicaid expansion, and said he has no plans to leave the Senate. He also called for better decorum in the chamber. Impact of budget delays Senate Democrats said the wait for local budgets, teachers, and those who would benefit from Medicaid expansion could not go on any longer. The federal government would pay 90 percent of the Medicaid expansion costs. Republican Sen. Bill Carrico said he would not listen to a lecture, since Democrats support abortion-rights. That was just one piece of how Republicans opposed to expansion pushed back on the Senate floor Tuesday evening, during what effectively became a debate over Medicaid expansion despite no bill sitting before the body. He argued that free trade agreements and warnings that tobacco has negative health effects have been the key drivers of economic problems in southwest Virginia, and more people with Medicaid coverage could simply put more of a strain on hospitals. A number of Republicans who remain opposed to expansion have focused on potential costs of the system. The Associated Press contributed to this report. All Rights Reserved.

In the House of Delegates, Republicans have a dominant 67-33 majority. Needless to say, there is absolutely no way the GOP can lose its edge in the lower chamber this cycle. Clearly, the state midterm cycles (green squares) have tended to be notably lower than other cycles. Chart 1: Turnout of registered voters in Virginia elections, 1997 to present Source: Virginia Dept. of Elections The lack of competition in most legislative elections will surely help depress turnout, too. A huge number of 2015 races will feature no opposition or at least no major-party opposition. In the Senate, just 23 of 40 contests will feature at least two candidates; half will have candidates from both major parties. In the House, only 38 of 100 elections will have at least two candidates; just 29 will have major-party matchups. The paucity of competitive races is also a result of having few seats that even could be competitive in a relatively neutral political environment. In the House, 13 seats were decided by five or fewer in 2014. Gov. Bill Bolling breaking ties in favor of the GOP). Thus, the playing field is extremely small, especially in the Senate. Stretching from inside the western city limits of Richmond out into Chesterfield and Powhatan counties in the western suburbs and exurbs, the 10th Virginia Senate District (SD-10) is ostensibly the keystone seat for a post-2015 majority. The retirement of long-time state Sen. John Watkins (R), a centrist Republican (e.g. he backed Medicaid expansion), opened the seat up, giving the Democrats a real shot at winning a district that they have narrowly won in every statewide election going back to 2012. Given the stakes, both have received large sums from related party committees and partisan outside groups. The key to SD-10 may be Chesterfield County. In 2011, Watkins won reelection by 13 points, the most competitive contest he ever endured. So he may get a slight boost there, especially as it contains most of the more Democratic-leaning parts of Chesterfield. One difficult-to-calculate variable is the role of two minor candidates in the SD-10 contest. Or the two could more-or-less cancel each other out. The Libertarian candidate, Carl Loser (pronounced LO-zer), may harm Sturtevant to some small extent (Libertarians tend to draw more from the GOP), while independent Marleen Durfee could conceivably have more appeal among Democratic leaners (she lost to a Republican while seeking reelection to the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors in 2011). As far as anyone can tell, the SD-10 race is a total toss-up, and it may keep everyone up late on Election Night. If Democrats win, they may well regain control of the Senate; if Republicans win, they are almost certain to retain the upper chamber. That leaves an extremely narrow path back to a majority: Win SD-10 and hold everything else to attain a 20-20 tie. Thing is, Republicans have a legitimate shot at winning at least one of two districts currently held by Democrats in the Virginia Senate. In suburban-exurban Northern Virginia, the 29th Senate District is open following the retirement of veteran Sen. Chuck Colgan (D), while down in the greater Roanoke area Sen. John Edwards (D) faces a serious challenge in the 21st Senate District. SD-29 forms a narrow southeast-to-northwest band across Prince William County, taking in the small independent cities of Manassas and Manassas Park. But of course a presidential electorate is nothing like an off-off, state midterm cycle electorate. Moreover, Republicans may have found an issue that could play big in SD-29 and some other Northern Virginia Senate and House districts: tolls. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) is backing a plan to toll vehicles with fewer than three occupants during rush hour on Interstate 66 inside the Beltway, a proposal that has sparked opposition from Republicans as well as many Northern Virginia Democrats. Carrying the Democratic banner is Jeremy McPike, who works in the city of Alexandria but has lived in Prince William County most of his life. An interesting part of this race is the fact that Colgan, who will retire after 40 years in the Senate, is probably the most moderate member of the Democratic caucus. For years he occupied previous incarnations of SD-29 that were more Republican, causing the GOP to always target him unsuccessfully. Now one wonders if the shoe is on the other foot, with Parrish serving as the moderate Republican who might be able to win a Democratic-leaning seat. This appears to be the seat most likely to dash Democratic hopes of Senate control on Election Night. The other seat Republicans have in their sights is SD-21, which runs from the city of Roanoke through part of Roanoke County into Montgomery and Giles counties. Going into Election Day 2011, there were some rumblings that Edwards might lose. Caldwell may have exactly the profile to actually impact the outcome in this race. If he shaves off even just two or three points mostly from Edwards while Dye runs better in Roanoke, Edwards may find himself in a true nail-biter. Curiously, Edwards got an endorsement that, on the surface, should boost him to some degree in more rural southwest Virginia: Despite having a (D) beside his name, Edwards once again earned the backing of the National Rifle Association. Increasingly, the Democratic rank and file will not brook heterodoxy on gun control, and with the late August shooting of two WDBJ television employees in nearby Moneta, VA, the issue is still fresh on the minds of voters in the region. Thus, Edwards could have some problems with his left flank, worsening turnout issues that already complicate things for Democrats. But Republicans see this seat as their most likely pickup after SD-29, and beating Edwards would almost assuredly guarantee the GOP continued control of the Senate. Other Senate races of note Democrats remain hopeful about winning the 7th Senate District, a potentially swingy Virginia Beach-area seat. Wagner must be a considered a favorite to retain his seat. Another seat that may be a bridge too far for Democrats is the 13th Senate District, located in western Fairfax County and northern Loudoun County. Socially conservative incumbent Sen. Dick Black (R) has a history of controversial comments that could theoretically make him vulnerable. Such remarks have proven to be useful fundraising fodder for Democrats running against him, and the 2015 cycle is no exception: Dr. Jill McCabe (D), a pediatrician, has kept neck-and-neck with Black in fundraising and is regarded as a strong recruit for Democrats. Republicans have their own second tier of Senate targets. In the 6th Senate District, located in Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore, Sen. Lynwood Lewis (D) won a special election to replace now-Lt. Gov. Northam in January 2014 by just 11 votes, a race that was far, far closer than many observers initially anticipated. Still, the incumbent has outraised his opponent, Richard Ottinger (R), nearly two-to-one, so Lewis remains a favorite. The GOP also hopes to possibly spring a surprise in the 39th Senate District, which runs from the city of Alexandria all the way into Prince William County. There, incumbent Sen. George Barker (D) is facing Joe Murray (R), a former Capitol Hill staffer. Still, it should be included as one to keep an eye on. With such low turnout, there is always the chance for some unexpected results; 2015 may be no different. But in the battle for control of the Virginia Senate, which is the focal point of this election, the seats above are the ones that appear most competitive in 2015. Overall, the road to a majority in the Senate mainly runs through SD-10, SD-21, and SD-29. Senate district numbers are colored according to the party that currently controls them. Total amount raised is through Sept. 30. House district numbers are colored according to the party that currently controls them. Total amount raised is through Sept. 30. Source: Virginia Public Access Project At first glance, it might seem as if Democrats should be able to add a seat or two given how seemingly overextended Republicans are in the House, but that is far from guaranteed based on a seat-by-seat analysis. One final point: A great unknown for the House going forward is a pending court case regarding the boundary lines of 12 districts around the state. As time passes and no decision is reached, this wild scenario becomes less and less likely as appeals (if necessary) would delay things further, but there certainly remains a chance that a new map could be drawn that would impact the partisan makeup of the House markedly during the next gubernatorial cycle in 2017."}

The message from Democratic voters, who came out in droves for an off-year election, was loud and clearly aimed at the president. Even though Northam and his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, sought to distance themselves from Trump during the fall campaign, voters used the opportunity to make a statement. They not only elected a Democratic governor by the largest margin in a generation but also defeated a slew of Republican state legislators. A transgender political neophyte, Danica Roem, knocked off one of Virginia's most prominent social conservatives, Robert G. Marshall, who had insisted on referring to her with male pronouns throughout the campaign. A daughter of a Salvadoran immigrant defeated a 30-year Air Force veteran incumbent who won previous elections by positioning himself as a moderate Republican who cherished civility. Caption Voters in Virginia elected Democrat Ralph Northam over Republican Ed Gillespie as the next governor. Astrid Riecken Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. But while Democrats swept races for New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and all three statewide posts in Virginia, Tuesday's vote offered no definitive guidance about whether the torrent of anti-Trump votes can translate into an effective strategy for Democrats in swing or red states in next year's congressional elections. No Republican has won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009, and what was long considered a swing state is now represented by two Democratic senators, has elected Democratic governors in four of the past five cycles, and is governed by a legislature that took a big step back from Republican dominance toward relative balance Tuesday. Some Democrats cheered the Virginia results as a sign of things to come, noting that 23 House Republicans hold seats in districts Democrat Hillary Clinton won last year. But others warned that the Virginia results may say little about Democratic appeal beyond the mostly coastal states where Clinton did well. The Democrats are just going after the heavily populated areas and the college graduates. The shape of Northam's victory gave Democrats both hope and pause. He drew larger portions of the vote than Clinton did in every region of Virginia, outperforming her especially among young people and white women with college degrees, according to preliminary exit polls. But Northam failed to make gains in Democratic weak spots such as with rural and less-educated voters. The Virginia vote left both parties deeply divided. Despite the win, Democrats remain split between those who thought Northam's moderate approach and quiet manner provided a welcome salve to Trump's disruptive style, and others who argued that the Democrats would have done far better had they taken a more confrontational, progressive- populist approach in the style of Bernie Sanders or Northam's primary opponent, former congressman Tom Perriello. Gillespie, the consummate establishment figure, was a D.C. lobbyist and former head of the Republican National Committee, and he for a time led the party's effort to reach out to Hispanics and diversify the base. But this fall, he sought to pitch himself to Never Trump moderates as a serious advocate for tax cuts even as he rebranded himself for the Trump base as a fire-breathing fighter defending Confederate monuments and attacking criminal gangs of undocumented Hispanic immigrants. The Trump voters are still important, but they weren't enough to win here last year, and they certainly weren't enough tonight. But there was no sign Tuesday night that the president or his supporters were eager to shift course. It's up to the Republicans in Congress. Even amid their evening of celebration, some Democrats worried that the Virginia victory would mask the fact that the party has still not found a way to connect with voters between the coasts. On paper, a Democratic victory may have seemed inevitable in Virginia. The history and math were lined up solidly against Gillespie and the Republicans. Virginia was the only Southern state Clinton won last year, Trump remains deeply unpopular there, and Virginians have a long history of turning against the party of the new president. Northam's path to victory was pocked with land mines. But despite Gillespie's aggressive ad campaign, which slammed Northam as soft on pedophiles and too lenient toward the Latino MS-13 gang, Democrats came out in force to make their statement. Virginians weren't buying it. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters."}

During a court hearing earlier last week, the state disclosed that a total of at least 384 registered voters were assigned to the wrong House district. The new details of the investigation showed that the issues confirmed during this limited investigation include voters tied to the 28th, 88th and now the 2nd House District. The Department of Elections disclosed Wednesday that at least 384 registered voters in the Fredericksburg area were misassigned one way or the other between the 28th House District and the 88th. The 28th District race is separated by just 82 votes and could determine which party controls the House of Delegates. The Department of Elections generally has not audited the information entered into the state voter registration database by local elections officials, and only began using modern mapping technology on a limited basis last year. The current state investigation over the last two weeks or so has focused only on the Fredericksburg area, where the 28th District race is separated by just 82 votes and could determine which party controls the House of Delegates. Republican Bob Thomas leads the 28th District race in Stafford and Fredericksburg by just 82 votes. The State Board of Elections had been set to certify the results last Monday, but delayed the action to allow for further investigation into the misassigned voters.

Some of the Democratic voters who were given ballots listing the wrong race are also expected to file federal lawsuits seeking a new election. The political make-up in the General Assembly could change dramatically if Democrats flip results in the 28th District or two other races that are expected to go to recounts.

This is the first tight general election in either of the state House districts at issue since lines were redrawn after the 2010 census. In the 28th District, Republican House Speaker Bill Howell chose to retire this year. In the 88th, Republican Mark Cole is expected to again win re-election in any circumstance. Even in this election, one precinct in Fredericksburg shows only a single vote cast in the 88th District race. The issue was only exposed this year after Democratic voters who knew what district they were supposed to be voting in complained about getting the wrong ballot. A city attorney told Fredericksburg elections officials to keep the polls open. Based on what is already known, before any additional investigations, this basic elections issue could have a larger impact than many other more high profile issues, especially since a recount or redo of the 28th District election could swing control of the House of Delegates from Republicans to Democrats. One potential legislative change that could reduce the likelihood of similar problems in the future is a requirement, similar to one in some other states, that local precinct boundaries be entirely within one state-level district or another.

With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Tuesday was the best day for Democrats politically since Barack Obama won reelection in 2012. Remember, conservatives scored significant victories in the November 2014, 2015 and 2016 elections. Democrats desperately needed some wins after they went all-in on a House special election in Georgia this spring and lost. Last night, they got them. Voters came out in droves. They braved the rain and the cold to send a message to President Trump. The results across the country represent nothing less than a stinging repudiation of Trump on the first anniversary of his election. -- Democrat Ralph Northam was elected governor of Virginia Tuesday by an unexpectedly large margin of nine percentage points. He won more votes than any previous candidate for Virginia governor. Four in 10 Virginia voters yesterday approved of the job that the president is doing, according to preliminary exit polls. Gillespie received over 9 in 10 votes from Trump approvers, but among the larger group of Trump disapprovers, Northam had nearly as large an advantage: 87 percent. Half as many (17 percent) sought to express support for the president, while 47 percent said Trump was not a factor in their choice. -- Women made the difference. Married women voted for Northam by 10 points according to preliminary exit polls, 54 percent to 44 percent. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump eked out a one-point lead with this group, 48 percent to 47 percent. Married women consisted of 30 percent of Virginia voters this year, about the same share as in 2016 and 2014. -- Rep. Scott Taylor, a Republican who represents Virginia Beach, said both Democrats and Republicans registered their disenchantment with Trump. Democrats came out en masse in protest. This was their first chance to mobilize the base. The lesson here is that Republicans have to get their act together. Despite active opposition from the Republican governor and an influx of outside money, the measure passed by a nearly 20-point margin. This will mean health-care coverage for an estimated 70,000 low-income residents. By winning a special election, Democrats took control of the Senate in Washington State. This gives the party full control of all three states on the West Coast: a blue wall of sorts. Joyce Craig is the first Democrat elected mayor there in 14 years. In North Carolina, the Republican mayor of Fayetteville lost his bid for a third term. Maine approving Medicaid expansion by such a margin should be a warning sign for Republicans to tread very carefully when it comes to their continuing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In Virginia, the network exit poll asked respondents which one of five issues mattered most in deciding their vote for governor: 39 percent said health care, far more than any other issue. And health-care focused voters favored Northam by a giant 77 percent to 23 percent margin in preliminary exit polls. Gillespie won handily among those who named taxes and immigration as their top issue. The candidates split among those who picked gun policy. -- To understand the true magnitude of the Democratic victory, look to the down-ballot races in Virginia. Democrats, many of them unknown first-time candidates, are poised to pick up at least 14 seats in the House of Delegates. Four other races were so close that they qualify for a recount, and results will determine control of the chamber. Democrats needed to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the House of Delegates. No one thought going into last night that it was seriously in play. One ominous sign for congressional Republicans: Northam won the district held by Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) in the D.C. suburbs by 13 points. The results are a big validation for outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who is term-limited and could use the gains as a rationale to run for president in 2020. He was surprised by the scale of the pick-ups. Ten of their replacements will be women. Supporters of Ralph Northam cheer as he speaks at his victory rally at George Mason University in Fairfax. Democrats composed 41 percent of the electorate, up four points from 2013 and one point from last year. Republicans were 31 percent of the electorate, a record low in two decades of exit polls. -- Turnout was the highest in 20 years for a gubernatorial race, five percentage points and 10 percentage points higher than the last two. Consider this amazing statistic: In 2014, Gillespie won Loudoun County (DC exurbs) by 456 votes. -- Nonwhite voters turned out at presidential election rates in Virginia, surprising the experts who were trying to model the election on both sides. African Americans accounted for 21 percent of voters, according to the exits, the same as in 2016. When McAuliffe won four years ago, nonwhite voters accounted for 28 percent of the electorate. On Tuesday, they made up 33 percent of those who voted. That 5 percent is pivotal because black voters favored Northam by a 73-point margin and Hispanics favored Northam by 33 points.

Bill de Blasio easily won a second term as mayor of New York City. (Dave Weigel) Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was reelected by a 30-point margin. In the short term, the defeat is likely to broaden a deepening divide between traditional Republicans, who have lost influence among grass-roots GOP voters, and the new populist conservatives who have embraced the polarizing approach of the president. In the aftermath of defeat, some Republicans called for staying the course. HOW THE RETURNS PLAYED ON SOCIAL MEDIA: -- Yes, Virginia went for Clinton last year. Yes, the demographics are changing. But it was anything but inevitable that Northam would win. The bigger explanation is a backlash to Trump and Trumpism, pure and simple. Democrats were gleeful and expressed hope that Republicans elsewhere will be less inclined to replicate the tactics in 2018. From a former senior adviser to Barack Obama: At least Ed Gillespie still has his dignity. Oh wait, never mind. From the chief strategist for Ohio Gov.

Democrats were hoping that the purple-turning-blue state would continue to trend in their direction, and the large margin of victory for Northam seems to point in this direction. See how we got here, through 73 years of electoral history. At this time, parties in the U.S. were much more geographically than ideologically based, according to Geoffrey Skelley, associate editor of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. As a result, Virginia went Republican for the presidential election and Democratic for state-level positions. Vocal civil rights opponent Barry Goldwater saw some success in Southern Virginia in his 1964 presidential campaign. Even third-party candidates such as segregationist George Wallace won some counties down south. In 1969, a Republican won the Virginia governorship for the first time in a century. Like much of the country, Ronald Reagan won Virginia in a landslide in 1980 and 1984. A Democrat held the governorship from 1982 until 1994, including a resounding 11-point win by Gerald Baliles in 1985. The population of Northern Virginia continued to grow and turn deeper and deeper blue, producing huge margins for Democrats such as President Barack Obama and Gov. Tim Kaine, who is now a senator. The more rural southern and southwestern Virginia started leaning right more consistently, except in college towns. On Nov. 7, 2017 margins in the D.C. suburbs were easily enough to give Ralph Northam the victory over Republican Ed Gillespie.

This time, Lewis wins by substantial margin in 6th District. State Sen. Lynwood Lewis, D-Accomac, will hold onto the state Senate seat he first won by 11 votes in a special election last year. His margin of victory was better this time around, winning Virginia's 6th Senate District by nearly 5,400 votes. With 55 of 56 precincts reporting, the unofficial results from the state Board of Elections were Lynwood Lewis, D, 16,764; Richard Ottinger, R, 11,374. Lewis took about 59.5 percent of the 28,193 votes cast, which carried him over Norfolk-based maritime lawyer and Republican newcomer Richard Ottinger, who garnered just over 40 percent.

(Daily Press Photo Staff) Both Lewis and Ottinger made a bid for the middle during the campaigns to separate themselves from the partisan rancor. Lewis attributed his win to his experience and reputation and said his constituents could count on more of the work he's been doing over the last 22 months. Lewis, also a lawyer by trade, spent a decade in the House of Delegates before winning the Senate seat after Ralph Northam's election to lieutenant governor. Senate Majority Leader Thomas K.

Midterms Matter. Video: Person Who Owns Home Where Shaun Brown Is Registered to Vote Says Brown Never Lived There or Rented From Her Midterms Matter. Day Two, Turnout Problems. Day Three, Past Mistakes. Day Four, Downstate Democrats. Day Five, Unchallenged Incumbents. Virginia Democrats may be depressed with the first part of this series, but this holiday season, they have a lot to be thankful for. First, good girls and boys of all ages across Virginia have opened up their invitations to an inauguration featuring three Democratic officials. Combined with Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, the party has demonstrated that the far right is no longer welcome in statewide elections in the Commonwealth. In 2014, Mark Warner will be up for reelection and Virginia Republicans are desperate to find a warm body with a pulse to run against him. Right now, with concerns over the implementation of Obamacare, his numbers may be softer, but this will be temporary as the health care roll out improves in 2014. I question what Republican will be foolish enough to run; Warner will march onward to reelection. Even with a strong challenger, only delusional Tea Partiers believe Warner is truly vulnerable. Make no mistake; the presidential hopeful is preparing a significant campaign in order to run up his margins. Also, stay tuned for a return of Sarvis. His big donor supporters wanted to secure ballot access in Virginia for the Libertarian Party. They fell short in 2013 but have another shot in 2014. Also watch for efforts to target Democratic voters by selling Sarvis as a protest vote and a way to express support for a more liberal agenda on gay marriage or marijuana than what Warner currently supports for. In an early Christmas surprise, long-time Republican Congressman Frank Wolf announced his retirement next year. Earlier, there were hopes that there would be a wide-open Republican primary, featuring everyone from Tim Hugo to Artur Davis. Doubtful. Watch Randy Forbes for a potential retirement in the next few cycles. In either case, it will be very ironic if one of the gay Republicans, Carl DeMaio, manages to win and then goes on to serve on the Armed Services Committee with Forbes (very plausible for a San Diego area representative). If Buck McKeon retires, and the Armed Services Chairmanship passes to Texan Mac Thornberry instead of Forbes, it will be at least six years before Forbes has another shot at the gavel. Evandra Thompson, who lost to Delegate Rosalyn Dance in the Democratic primary earlier this year, might be an interesting choice if she can find a way to put more public experience under her belt. Given the important role that Virginia has played in electing Barack Obama, twice, and our bench of nationally recognized leaders (Warner and Kaine), we should also be ready for the chance that one of them will join the next Democratic Administration. But if not as VP (doubtful), Kaine could still make a good cabinet pick. RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR 2018 Elections Midterms Matter.

Senate races expected to have wide-ranging impact Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), seen at the South Carolina Democratic Party state convention on Saturday, is going after national donors to focus on upcoming state Senate races. All 40 Senate seats are up for election in November, along with all 100 in the House of Delegates. These critical races get underway with Democrats at a disadvantage: Republicans already have control of the Senate by a slim margin of 21 seats to 19. Democrats have to hold on to every one of their seats and pick up another just to reach a tie. Democrats would hold sway over a 20-20 Senate because Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has the power to break most tie votes. Holding their current seats is not a given. Democrats thought they had a shot against Sen. Bryce E. Reeves (R-Spotsylvania), a freshman who won by a slim margin four years ago. But his Democratic challenger, Traci Dippert, unexpectedly quit the race this month after struggling to raise funds, leaving the party scrambling for a replacement. Two open seats are thought to be in play, to replace retiring Sens. Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William) and John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan). In those districts, Democrats are embroiled in tough primary battles while Republicans have their candidates in place. The GOP has challenges of its own, starting with demographic shifts that could make it hard to retain the seat that Watkins held onto by dint of his moderate image and personal popularity. Democrats recruited Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, to take on Black, a vocal opponent of abortion. So far, McAuliffe has not raised significantly more than his predecessor, Robert F. McDonnell (R), had by the same point in his governorship. But that is expected to change. But he was optimistic that the GOP can overcome that. Leaders in both parties said their chances were bolstered by high-quality candidates. Democrats, for instance, have been singing the praises of McCollum, a Cox Communications executive, minister and former Army Ranger who grew up in public housing in Richmond. Parrish is the son of the late Harry J. Parrish, a long-serving mayor and state delegate. Among the seats Democrats hope to pick up is the Richmond-area territory that Watkins is giving up. Democrats have won every statewide race there since 2012. Republicans say they can beat that trend with Glen Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member and lawyer with three adopted children. Before Democrats can take him on, they have to contend with a three-way primary among environmental activist Emily Francis, Chesterfield County Supervisor Daniel Gecker and former delegate Alexander McMurtrie. The establishment is firmly behind Gecker, a lawyer, but some liberals have grumbled because he once represented Kathleen E. Willey, the White House volunteer who accused President Clinton of groping her in the Oval Office in 1993. Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) said he was confident that his party would prevail. Republicans are trying to knock off Edwards, a member of the Senate since 1996, with Nancy Dye, a retired surgeon, businesswoman and civic leader. Caldwell supporters were circulating petitions last week to put him on the ballot, according to two people familiar with those efforts. Comments The story must be told.

Using the prospect of a deadlocked Senate as leverage, Democrats are trying to beef up their influence on crucial committees, where the fate of legislation is largely decided. Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) and Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) laid out their demands in a letter they had hand-delivered Friday to Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City). But Saslaw said the effort was akin to the ordinary horse-trading that goes on during any General Assembly session. As Senate Democrats attempt to leverage their newfound muscle for more committee power, their counterparts in the House of Delegates hope only to amend the budget approved Sunday by the House Appropriations Committee. The committee had added millions of dollars for schools, local governments and health care, but that still fell far short of what Democrats desired. The funds are usually provided to Northern Virginia school districts to woo employees in the expensive job market. At a meeting of the Northern Virginia legislators Monday, House Democrats vowed to try to round up the votes needed to add cost-of-competing funds to the budget. But they acknowledged it would be a nearly impossible task; Republicans outnumber Democrats 67-32, with one independent who caucuses with Republicans. But funding still falls short of what some Senate Democrats would have liked. On the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, Sen. Ryan T. McDougle (R-Hanover) ticked off many of the programs Republicans had agreed to better fund at the request of Democrats. Saslaw and McEachin have asked that more Democrats get appointed to certain committees, that some Republicans get removed, and that leadership of the powerful Senate Finance Committee be split between Republican and Democratic co-chairs. Their proposal would affect six of the 11 Senate committees, which Democrats had controlled for four years. Every committee would continue to be chaired by Republicans, with the exception of the co-chaired finance committee. Comments The story must be told.

The decision means that Republicans control 51 seats in the House of Delegates while Democrats control 49. The action shuts down one potential route, but it does not end Democrats' hopes to win control of the chamber. In that race, Republican Robert Thomas leads Democrat Joshua Cole by 82 votes in the contest to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). Alcorn also said the board does not have the power to order any of the available remedies, such as a new election, which a judge could do. The losing candidate also could file a contest with the House, which could require a new election or pick a winner itself through a floor vote. In the 40th District, Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) has a 106-vote lead over Democrat Donte Tanner, while in the 94th District, Del. David E. Yancey (R-Newport News) is up just 10 votes over Democrat Shelly Simonds. Monday's decision came three weeks after Election Day, and a week after the board had certified election results in 98 other House seats. The board initially held off on the two Fredericksburg-area House seats amid revelations that some voters in the 28th and 88th districts had been erroneously assigned to the wrong race. The assignment errors affect both races, but the focus has been on the 28th because the margin of victory was just 82 votes. It is one of three tight GOP wins statewide that are likely headed for recounts. Democrats would need one more victory to force a power-sharing deal with Republicans and two more to take the reins of the chamber for the first time since 2000. The board's decision was a disappointment to Democrats and their allies, who since Nov. 7 have filed three lawsuits asserting that 28th District voters had been disenfranchised in various ways. Two of the cases were dismissed. In the third case, a federal judge rejected Democrats' request for a temporary restraining order to block the state board from certifying the 28th District election. But he did not dismiss the case, leaving Democrats the option of asking the judge for a new election. House Republicans had threatened to file a lawsuit of their own if the board did not certify the results by Monday. Partisan tensions appeared to be running high at the start of Monday's meeting, when Alcorn made a motion to retreat into executive session so members could confer with lawyers. Republican Clara Belle Wheeler abstained from voting on that motion. But she came out of the closed-door meeting with a smile and soon voted, along with Alcorn and Singleton McAllister, to certify the results. But if his election had remained uncertified, Mark Cole would not have been seated when the legislature convenes in January. That would have evenly split the chamber, 49 seats controlled by Republicans and 49 controlled by Democrats. Republicans boasted a 66-to-34 majority going into the Nov. 7 elections. After further investigation, he said the state had discovered a total of 384 misassigned voters, including some in the neighboring 2nd House District. Of those, 147 of the misassigned voters cast ballots. Elections officials said they are not sure why Pitchford, who died in April, made the changes. Comments The story must be told.

{"URL_s":"http://www.peoplesworld.org/medicaid-fight-in-virginia-takes-off","Timestamp_s":"20180819002500","Sentences_t":"The Republican leadership is solidly against Medicaid expansion. Nevertheless, McAuliffe says he may push for executive authority to implement Medicare expansion, if the legislature does not act. Virginia politician brag about theirs being a prosperous state with a low unemployment level (5.4 percent). However, this seeming prosperity is obtained at the cost of low wages and benefits for many workers. The average weekly wage in Virginia is higher than the national norm, but this is deceptive. The higher wage levels are all concentrated in the Washington D.C. suburbs and exurbs in Northern Virginia and a few other places, and result to a large extent from economic activities of the federal government and its contractors. In much of the rest of the state, including the depressed coal mining areas of Appalachia and rural, agricultural communities, wages are low. In other words, Virginia is a state with a large number of working poor. One of the things that this implies is that many workers in Virginia do not have access to workplace-sponsored health insurance, a thing generally associated with strong unions and higher wages. This means that the Medicaid expansion, covering poor and disabled people, was meant for places like Virginia. Like the right in other areas of the country, they also take the attitude that the poor have only themselves to blame for their poverty and get too much government help as it is. It is no wonder that Virginia is in 48th place in state spending for Medicaid, with a million of its 8.3 million residents lacking health insurance. Should Medicaid be expanded in Virginia, about 400,000 of these would be qualified for coverage. Not only labor but the state Chamber of Commerce supports expansion. The sequester cut federal help to health care institutions, which see Medicaid expansion as making up for that loss. As many as 30,000 jobs in the health care field could be created via Medicaid expansion, increasing the income tax flow to both state and federal governments at a very low cost. During the 2013 Virginia elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and the House of Delegates, gubernatorial candidate McAuliffe and other Democratic Party candidates ran on a platform that included Medicaid expansion under ACA, which had been opposed by then Governor Bob McDonnell and the Republicans. If the Democrats get a majority in the Senate, they can make headway there, but in the House of Delegates, there will be a real problem. On Monday January 20, Governor McAuliffe went on the offensive. This seems to indicate a prolonged standoff.

In the House, only 38 out of 100 have two or more candidates, with only a handful expected to be competitive.

Greg Habeeb, said there are many factors that explain the lack of competition, and a lack of effort by the Democratic Party to recruit candidates is one of them. He noted that Republicans currently control more than a dozen House districts that President Barack Obama won in 2012. Under the Byrd machine, legislative lines were drawn to favor rural districts over urban areas and often had to be redrawn under court order, Heinemann said. Democrats were hoping for a similar outcome based on the same legal arguments involving the state House districts, but a different panel of federal judges ruled 2 to 1 on Thursday that the current state House districts were legal. The plaintiffs in the case have signaled they intend to appeal.

News4's Tom Sherwood reports. Not that you'd necessarily know that. This is a low-key election. There aren't a lot of competitive races, and it's an off-year for politics -- all of which could lead to low turnout. But this election matters -- possibly more than you think it does. So here are four things you need to know about the Nov. 3 election. Some basics: Polls will be open from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. Click here to find your polling location. Voters in Virginia are required to show a photo ID to vote, but that ID does not have to show the voter's address. 1. Voters Could Shift Balance of Power in Va. Senate While Republicans are expected to maintain control in the House of Delegates, the Democrats only need to pick up one seat to gain control of the Senate. Right now, Republicans have 21 seats to the Democrats' 19. Democrats believe they will pick up a seat in the Richmond area, where Chesterfield Supervisor Dan Gecker (D) faces Glen Sturtevant (R). But District 29 in Prince William County is also considered a competitive race. If Democratic candidate Jeremy McPike wins the seat, the Democrats could regain control. If both parties end up with 20 seats, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) will cast the tie-breaking vote. 2. Many Voters Won't See Very Many Choices on Their Ballot While there are some competitive races, many voters will not see many options on their ballot. In the state Senate, 22 out of 40 races have more than one candidate, but only six are expected to be close. In the House, only 38 out of 100 have two or more candidates, with only a handful expected to be competitive.

But those requests were made by Republicans and Democrats alike, and GOP lawmakers dispute that the current map is squelching competition. 3. Low Voter Turnout Means Every Vote Counts Low voter turnout has led to some surprising upsets in years past. Last year, Eric Cantor's defeat to Tea Party candidate Dave Brat cost the number two House Republican his seat in Congress and left the political world in shock. Locally, Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille blamed low turnout when he lost the Democratic mayoral primary to councilmember Allison Silberberg. Silberberg won by just over 300 votes. Euille has been mayor since 2003, and had never been opposed prior to this summer. There's no Republican candidate on the ballot. from loading. All rights reserved."}

We are in no position to make suggestions, I know. Abbott of Texas, Brownback of Kansas, Walker of Wisconsin, Snyder of Michigan, Scott of Florida, and McCrory of North Carolina are bringing their states down. There are others, of course. Their legislatures are even worse. Some are actively trying to tie the hands of their state governments for all time, with the oxymoronically named Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). This clone of the awful Colorado ALEC-driven TABOR is eyed by NC legislative destructos and winding its way into discussions. Such an amendment would cement austerity and relegate public schools, roads and other good things states once did to history. So many of the NC schools, their students and their teachers are amazing. The quality and rigor is astonishing. But instead of rewarding teachers, the GA finds ways to rig the data and punish them. The GA is hell-bent on driving away experienced teachers, who are leaving in droves. Schools start Monday and TAs have no contracts. Some veteran teachers have gotten pay cuts. However, as the legislative assault on public schools continues, no school, even the high-achieving ones in NC are really lucky. All the accomplished, hard working students who succeed do so despite the legislature. What is also clear is that there must be a huge correlation between legislators doing poorly in school themselves and those who chose to run for public office in states like NC. Voters in NC understand how dreadful our legislature (GA) is. And more to the point, if we do something electorally, will the GA nullify the effects of our elections, as they did for Wake County, the city of Greensboro, and the NC State Supreme Court. It is hard to overcome all the low information voters out there. To do it, you need conversations better than a phone bank call permits. 10 conversations a week could help.

Even in those races, most were contests in name only, with an average victory margin of nearly 20 percentage points. All 100 seats in the House were on the ballot, but just 29 of them featured a Republican pitted against a Democrat; of those contests, just six resulted in competitive races, meaning a victory margin of less than 10 percentage points. In races for the 40-member Senate, the competition was only slightly less tepid. Six of the races were relatively tight, while 20 candidates faced no major-party opponent whatsoever. No wonder voter participation, which has plummeted for years when state legislative races top the ballot, fell to an all-time low on Tuesday. Back then, and until computer-assisted gerrymandering was fine-tuned in the mid-1990s, turnout generally exceeded 50 percent in legislative-only election years. Incumbents of both parties are guilty of having deployed technological wizardry to manipulate electoral maps for their own political benefit and job security. In a state as evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans as any in the nation, there are vanishingly few state legislative districts drawn in such a way as to enable genuine electoral competition. When nearly every candidate wins by acclamation or blowout, democracy becomes a sham. When incumbents never face real competition from the opposing party, they move to the ideological extremes to protect themselves from primary challenges, thus minimizing the chance of compromise in the process of actual lawmaking. Virginia, where Republicans have had the edge in Richmond, is not the only offender. Maryland, where Democrats are dominant in Annapolis, is just as guilty of running an incumbent-protection racket by means of cartographic shenanigans. In both states, Republican and Democratic governors have embraced the need for redistricting reform, meaning the creation of independent commissions that would re-draw legislative lines without regard to incumbent protection. Entrenched lawmakers in both states have arrogantly dismissed those proposals, but the governors should push ahead. By reforming in tandem, they could defuse arguments that only one party would benefit, while restoring a system in which voters can choose their representatives, rather than the reverse.

Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) would be speaker if Republicans maintain control. With four races still too close to call, both parties are bracing for the messiest of all outcomes: a dead-even 50-50 split that requires power-sharing and a potentially ugly fight for the speakership. That would be triggered if Democrats pick up one of the four races that are close enough for a state-funded recount. Republicans have leads difficult to overcome in three of them, including Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax), who narrowly pulled ahead of his challenger after unofficial results were tallied. Del. David Yancey (R-Newport News) is just 12 votes ahead of Democratic challenger Shelly Simonds, with provisional ballots still being counted through Monday. Control of the chamber has implications for policy decisions affecting large swaths of Virginians, including whether Medicaid is expanded to an estimated 400,000 low-income residents and new gun control measures are implemented. Even if Democrats fall short, they have other options to take control of the legislature. They can lure Republican lawmakers to their side with the promise of plush committee assignments, or government jobs or Cabinet positions offered by Governor-elect Ralph Northam (D). But the GOP House leadership said their majority is secure because they are confident Yancey will hold his seat. Unlike the state Senate, where the lieutenant governor breaks ties, there is no such mechanism in the House. Virginia last saw an even split in the House of Delegates in 1999. Democrats held on to the speakership with a parliamentary maneuver, while committees that serve as gatekeepers for legislation were led by two chairs, one from each party. Political observers say that managing the battle for control of the legislature will be Northam's first chance to show leadership, with an opportunity for bipartisanship and to strengthen his negotiating hand. Unlike the man he is replacing, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), Northam has relationships with Republicans in the legislature stretching back a decade, to when he first became a lawmaker. He was so well-regarded by Republicans, in fact, that they tried to coax him into changing parties as part of a plot to take control of the Democratic state Senate. Democrats don't have all the leverage if control of the House of Delegates is in play, strategists said. Under one scenario, the Republicans could delay seating Simonds, if the Democrat prevails in a recount against Yancey, in time to elect a speaker of their own. A spokesman for Northam declined to tip his hand on how the future governor would maneuver to turn the General Assembly blue, but said he would be true to his campaign promise of working across the aisle. Republicans hold a 21 to 19 edge in the state Senate, with Lt. Gov.-elect Justin Fairfax (D) set to preside over the body and break ties. That happened in 1998, when then-Gov. Jim Gilmore (R) appointed a Democratic senator as his deputy transportation secretary, handing control of the Senate to Republicans as a result. And in 2014, Virginia Republicans took control of the Senate after Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell) resigned amid talks of a job with a state tobacco commission. Regardless of the parliamentary maneuvering and who ends up in power, Virginia Republicans are entering a new administration with far less clout than they had before Election Day. Albo, the retiring Republican lawmaker who will be replaced by a Democrat, lamented the vanishing breed of districts with voters willing to split their ballots. Gregory S.

Republican Robert Thomas beat Democrat Joshua Cole by 82 votes on Nov. 7 in a contest to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). But the outcome, which could affect which party leads the chamber, is in dispute because of errors that led 147 voters to cast ballots in the wrong race. Democrats on Wednesday filed an amended complaint, updating a lawsuit filed Nov. 21 in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. The original suit, filed on behalf of three voters who were denied the chance to vote in the proper race, sought a temporary restraining order to stop Virginia's Board of Elections from certifying the results of 28th District House race. U.S. Judge T.S. Ellis III denied that request but did not dismiss the suit, allowing for Wednesday's filing. Members said they were required by state law to certify the results despite irregularities and were powerless to require any available remedies, such as ordering a new election. They also said that certification was necessary before other challenges, such as a recount, could begin. The amended complaint asks the judge to order the state to decertify the election and to block Thomas from being seated as a delegate when the General Assembly convenes in January. Parker Slaybaugh, spokesman for Del. M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights), who is in line to become speaker if Republicans hold the majority, said House Republicans were dismayed by the filing. A date for that recount has not been officially set but Democrats and Republicans say it is likely to take place Dec. 21. G. Manoli Loupassi (R-Richmond) lost to Democrat Dawn Adams by 336 votes. That recount is scheduled for Dec. 20. Now the count is 49 Democrats and 51 Republicans.

But hours later, the Democrat trailing in that race filed another lawsuit in federal court. The suit was just one front in the struggle for House control, which could turn on three exceedingly close elections. All three appear headed for state-funded recounts. In one of the three, 10 votes separate the candidates. Stafford County Circuit Court Judge Victoria Willis denied the legal defense fund's request for an injunction, which would have required local elections officials to wait a week before declaring a winner in the race. The judge ruled that the group lacked standing to bring the suit because it was not clear that the two voters named as plaintiffs had been harmed. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the legal defense fund, told the judge that she had been unable to confirm reports that one or both of the plaintiffs had attended an elections board meeting a day earlier to defend their votes. Ifill said she had not been able to reach either. Ifill indicated in court that the group would seek to file another lawsuit on behalf of other voters who cast provisional ballots. In the meantime, Willis's ruling cleared the way for the county electoral board to begin counting provisional ballots cast in the race to succeed retiring House speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). View Graphic Virginia general election guide On election night, Republican Robert Thomas led Democrat Joshua Cole by 86 votes, a margin later adjusted to 84 after a few errors were corrected. After tallying provisional ballots Tuesday, Cole picked up two votes, shaving Thomas's lead to 82. The board also voted against counting 55 absentee ballots that were in dispute. The Democratic Party of Virginia said on Veterans Day that those ballots, believed to be from active-duty military voters, were left in the registrar's mailbox on Election Day. But elections officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, said that was not the case. The ballots were run-of-the-mill absentee ballots and were not delivered until 10 a.m. Nov. 8, the morning after the election, they said. Electoral Board Chairman Doug Filler, whose daughter is Del. Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax), argued that the ballots should be counted, suggesting that the post office might have been responsible for their delayed arrival. By Tuesday night, the Virginia House Democratic Caucus announced it had filed a lawsuit on Cole's behalf in Federal Court in Alexandria, demanding that the 55 absentee ballots be counted. Before the election, Republicans enjoyed a 66-to-34 majority in Richmond's lower chamber. Now, Democrats are within striking distance of taking control. They need one more victory to force a power-sharing deal with Republicans and two more to take the reins of the chamber for the first time since 2000. Democrats have secured wins in 49 out of 100 seats, with Republicans holding narrow leads in the Thomas-Cole contest and two others. After elections officials examined provisional ballots cast in District 40 on Monday, Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) saw his 115-vote lead over Democrat Donte Tanner shrink to 106 votes. In District 94, Del. David E. Yancey (R-Newport News) had his 13-vote lead over Democrat Shelly Simonds dwindle to 10.

If Democrats flip just one seat, however, they will take control of the chamber with the deciding vote from Democrat Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam. McAuliffe has a powerful ally in this election; New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg. It would also provide Bloomberg with a key talking point that gun restrictions can be politically popular in swing states ahead of the pivotal 2016 elections. The Virginia Senate elections are simply the highest profile of a number of proxy battles being fought this year in down-ballot races. In Colorado, millions have been spent on a school board election in Jefferson County, home to Golden, CO. Conservative groups have tried to counter the union spending, but will likely be vastly outspent. The fight is widely seen by many as a proxy for the fight over education reform. The measures supported by the conservatives are modest and generally popular with voters. The unions understand, however, that if the conservatives lose, other supporters of education reform will be reluctant to push policy proposals. These races rarely attract a lot of political attention. They won 6 of the 8 seats up for election. Another proxy fight is on the ballot in San Francisco. Successful ballot initiatives in cities like San Fran often become templates for new laws and regulations in other states. Voters in the critical swing state will decide Tuesday between two measures that would legalize pot in the Buckeye State. Ohio would be the most populous state to legalize pot. It is also a major midwestern state, far from the Mountain and Pacific West that is already moving towards legalization. Culturally, it would be a watershed moment and possibly force Presidential candidates to take a position on the issue. If the measure fails on Tuesday, it could return to the ballot next November, in time to boost turnout among younger voters. These proxy fights are healthy in our federalist system. Most decisions concerning laws and regulations ought to be decided at the state and local level. Conservatives in the 1980s and 1990s used local fights like these to frame the political landscape for larger battles. With Republicans in solid control of Congress, the left now has rediscovered state and local elections as a way to push their policies. While conservatives devote their energies to affecting change in Washington, large segments of the left are returning to local elections. If Democrats are able to win the state Senate, even partially on the back of the gun control issue, it will embolden gun control supporters in other states. New Virginia Majority, a new voter group, is testing get-out-the-vote efforts with non-English speakers. National conservatives, however, who rhetorically embrace the principle of federalism are largely absent from these contests.

Terry McAuliffe said recently that electing Democrats to the state Senate will help him advance his agenda on items such as Medicaid expansion, gun control and education spending even with a Republican-controlled House. Republicans have a 21-19 edge in the Senate that Democrats could wipe out by netting one seat, with Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam serving as a tie-breaker. Republicans are all but assured of retaining a solid grip on the House, where they hold a 67-33 advantage. The Senate races will be crucial for the term-limited Mr. McAuliffe and his prospects for advancing his agenda, as Statehouse Republicans have largely thwarted his big-ticket plans since he took office in January 2014. Mr. McAuliffe said recently that electing Democrats to the state Senate will help him advance his agenda on items such as Medicaid expansion, gun control and education spending even with a Republican-controlled House. Two Senate races drawing much of the attention as pickup opportunities for both sides are the contests to replace retiring Sens. Charles J. Colgan, Manassas Democrat, and John C. Watkins, Powhatan Republican. Mr. McAuliffe has accused Mr. Parrish and other Republicans of lying about the issue. The governor says that under his plan, single drivers would simply have a choice to pay to drive in the lanes that are currently HOV-only during rush hour inside the Beltway. Independent Marleen Durfee and Libertarian Carl Loser also are vying for the seat. Other groups also have entered the fray. As for the House, Mr. Skelley said there is a good chance that there will be no net change to the sizable Republican majority, though both sides are eyeing some pickup opportunities, including in Northern Virginia races. Democrat Jennifer Boysko is trying to win an open seat being vacated by retiring Republican Delegate Tom Rust in a contest in the 86th House District covering parts of Fairfax and Loudoun counties, running against Republican Danny Vargas and independent Paul Brubaker.

Terry McAuliffe. It is a big defeat for McAuliffe, a close ally for Hillary Clinton, and a big defeat for New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who donated heavily to Democrats in the hope of winning the Virginia electoral fights on a promise of more gun-control. Republicans beat back two serious challengers Tuesday, holding onto seats in the suburbs of Richmond and the Hampton Roads area. In another hotly contested race, Republican Hal Parrish holds a lead over Democrat Jerry McPike. If Parrish holds onto his lead, it would represent a Republican gain, as the two are battling to replace a retiring Democrat. McAuliffe, with considerable help from Bloomberg, bet his political capital on Democrats winning the upper Chamber. But he seems to have fallen far short. Republicans currently hold a 2-seat majority in the state Senate. Republicans have an overwhelming majority in the state House. Bloomberg was hoping to capitalize on the tragic shooting of two Virginia TV reporters by a disgruntled newsman earlier this Summer. He pumped millions into the race for two critical state Senate seats. As a result, both Democrats were able to dramatically outspend their Republican rivals. Bloomberg and his SuperPAC, Everytown for Gun Safety, hoped to show that Democrats could win on the issue of gun control. Also, Gov. McAuliffe had made enacting new restrictions on gun ownership a centerpiece of his campaigning for Democrats around the state. McAuliffe also campaigned aggressively for expanding Medicaid through ObamaCare and implementing universal preschool. Barred from running for reelection, McAuliffe will now face a united Republican legislature for his final two years in office. In many ways, this legislative election turned on issues central to her campaign."}

The House leadership tried to pass their bill through a suspension of the rules. They were wrong, but two Virginia Democrats joined 33 of their colleagues and voted with the Republicans, Gerry Connolly (D-11) and Don Beyer (D-8). CLOs are similar to those pooled mortgages that proved worthless and helped destroy our economy. That trick allows big banks to keep borrowing from the Fed to finance such derivatives. This latest attempt was simply trying to put more nails in the coffin of financial reform and regulation. GOPers even had a provision in their poison-to-the-consumer bill that would have enabled large corporation to stop releasing their annual reports in computer-friendly formats, thus making it more difficult for prospective investors to make informed judgments about whether to invest in them or not. Looking at the voting record of Gerry Connolly, there is no bias in favor of large banks. Don was completely on board with the progressive, anti-corporate governance platform that Howard Dean espoused, and I had great respect for him. I have no doubt that when, not if, this bill is brought up in the regular order of House business, it will pass, probably with 35 or more Democratic votes. It will probably pass in the Senate, as it is unlikely that there will be 41 Democratic votes to filibuster it.

Ralph Northam (D). Two days after that eloquent bid for bipartisanship for the good of the commonwealth, Republicans responded. Their uncompromising answer: Not so much. In summarily rejecting a package of gun-control bills backed by Mr. Northam, a Republican-controlled Senate committee made clear it had no interest in working with the governor on his legislative priorities. That Virginia voters showed support for these initiatives by electing Mr. Northam didn't seem to matter. Voting largely along party lines, the Senate Courts of Justice Committee on Monday rejected a number of modest measures proposed by Democrats to combat gun violence. The legislation that was voted down included requiring background checks for all gun purchases, mandating that gun owners report lost or stolen weapons and allowing localities to ban firearms at permitted events. In addition to not listening to an electorate that gave Mr. Northam a landslide victory and elected other gun-control proponents in upset races, Senate Republicans also paid no heed to last year's violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville where the response of authorities was inhibited by the heavy presence of guns. Bills similar to those killed by the Senate are pending in the House. Time will soon tell. Mr. Northam, for his part, vowed not to give up. That Mr. Northam came under immediate criticism from Republicans for a campaign-style tone is pretty rich considering the success of his most recent campaign and the refusal of Republicans to recognize it by working him even a little bit on needed gun control.

Polls gave Attorney General Jack Conway (D) a strong chance of beating Republican Matt Bevin, a staunch tea party supporter not much liked by the GOP establishment. A Conway victory would have been heralded by Democrats as a sign of the dangers of right-wing extremism to the Republican Party. Instead, Bevin won, and won big. Neither President Obama nor the Environmental Protection Agency is popular in those parts. In Virginia, Democrats had plausible hopes of taking control of the state Senate and needed to pick up only one seat to do it. Supporters of gun safety regulation poured in money, seeing a chance to deal a blow to the National Rifle Association in the state where it makes its headquarters. Advocates of universal background checks and other gun law reforms can fairly claim to have helped elect Democrat Jeremy McPike, who held on to an open state Senate seat in the Northern Virginia suburbs, and to have strengthened suburban Democrats in races for the state House of Delegates. A single seat bought a lot of bragging rights. But this Election Day brought very different news in other parts of the country. The impact could be substantial on matters ranging from voter identification laws to gun control and, in the long run, the drawing of legislative districts. Democrats also did well in local contests in swing suburban counties that have been moving their way over the past two decades, including Montgomery County in the Philadelphia suburbs and Loudoun County in Northern Virginia. They won key mayoral contests in Indiana and North Carolina and padded their already large majority in the New Jersey General Assembly. saw it as instructive. Ben Carson, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz all have reason to take heart. Yarmuth and other Democrats also pointed to low turnout among their supporters in nonpresidential years, aggravated by a Catch-22 in Republican-leaning states: Getting too close to Obama and the national party can hurt Democratic candidates in the broader electorate, but creating too much distance can dampen turnout among loyalists they badly need to show up. If there was one outcome on Tuesday that could push back against polarization (even as it also gave Democrats a chance to fight another gerrymander), it was the overwhelming victory of an Ohio referendum to overhaul the highly partisan process of drawing state legislative districts. Its supporters moved immediately to push for a similar referendum next year on congressional district boundaries. While a decline in gerrymandering would, at the moment, generally help Democrats, it would also give politicians an incentive to appeal to broader swaths of the electorate by creating less ideologically homogeneous districts. But new ways of drawing district lines can only do so much. The one large lesson from Tuesday is that the red parts of the country are getting even redder while the blue and some of the purple parts get bluer. We are still two Americas. E.J. Dionne Jr. E.J.

Democrats hope investment in data and field operations pays off Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is helping his party get ready state Senate races this year and the 2016 presidential election. The Democrats hope that the investment will pay off not just this year but also in 2016, when political observers expect Virginia to be one of the most competitive states in the presidential race. The state party has 69 paid field staffers working on five competitive state Senate races, about 14 times as many as it did in 2011, the last time only state lawmakers were on the ballot. McAuliffe, a close ally of former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, has made no secret of his plans to help the Democratic front-runner win in Virginia. While he was all over the country and television as her campaign chairman in 2008, this cycle he is focused on building up an infrastructure for Clinton in Virginia. Officials from both parties agree that data collection in Virginia is particularly challenging. More than a quarter of a million people leave the state each election cycle and a quarter of a million new people move in. Democrats say they have records of party preference for about 65 percent of the electorate. To build out a model to predict the behavior of the rest, they have done deep surveys on 7,000 people, with over-sampling in competitive state Senate districts. They have a ranking for everyone in the state based on their likelihood to support Democrats and likelihood to vote. Even with this investment, winning the state Senate will be a challenge for Democrats. Republicans have a strong and better-funded candidate running in Prince William County, where Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D) is retiring. In Virginia Beach, where Democrats are hoping to unseat Sen. Frank W. Wagner (R), their candidate has wounded himself by misrepresenting his military record. In 2007, when George W. Bush was nearing his seventh year in office, Democrats made historic gains in Virginia in part because of a national trend away from the GOP. Republicans see a similar White House fatigue this year, which is a boon for their party and a disadvantage for Democrats. A poll released Friday by Christopher Newport University backs up that confidence; likely voters support Republican Senate candidates by a 13-point margin. And Democrats who have previously worked in Virginia said that while the state Senate effort sounds very solid, so were past campaigns in the state. Republicans said their approach to organizing is different: They run their field operations through individual Senate campaigns, although state party Chairman John Whitbeck has also hired a dozen staffers to work the Senate races. In addition, the RNC has its own staff in each key area. And like the Democrats, the party has been training staff and volunteers in the kind of community organizing that was a hallmark of the Obama campaigns. Democrats say that relying on such consumer data is out of date and that the custom predictive models their party is using in Virginia are the future. Comments The story must be told.

Democrats snared at least 15 seats in an upset that stunned members of both parties and arrived with national implications. Unofficial returns showed Democrats unseating at least a dozen Republicans and flipping three seats that had been occupied by GOP incumbents who did not seek reelection. Four other races were so close that they qualify for a recount, and the outcome will determine control of the chamber. The results marked the most sweeping shift in control of the legislature since Reconstruction. Republicans, who have controlled the chamber since 2000, went into Tuesday holding 66 of 100 seats. Democrats fielded the most candidates in recent memory, including a record number of women. Control of the chamber may not be determined for days as provisional ballots are counted in narrow races. Democrats need to hold one seat where they are narrowly leading to ensure a 50-50 split where power sharing would be necessary, and to pick up an additional seat in a race eligible for a recount to take full control of the chamber. The election signaled a major shift in the gender of a body long dominated by men: Of the 15 seats Democrats flipped, all were held by men and 11 were won by women. Several of those women made history. One became Virginia's first openly transgender person to win elective office, unseating an opponent of LGBT rights. Another became the first open lesbian elected to the House of Delegates, another the first Asian American woman and two, both from diverse Prince William County, are set to be the first Latinas elected to the General Assembly. Although House races are normally seen as the sleepy backwater to the gubernatorial contest, they generated a surge of interest this year from activists energized by President Trump's election and new groups that see the legislative contests as an opportunity to test strategies and technologies ahead of next year's elections. Strategists said the results suggest trouble for Republicans. The highest-spending House of Delegates race was in southwest Virginia, where former television news anchor Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015, challenged Republican incumbent Joseph Yost. Subba Kolla, who would have been the body's first Indian American lawmaker, lost to Del. John J. Bell in Loudoun County, and Heather Cordasco fell to Del. Michael P. Mullin in Hampton Roads. Democrats flipped the most seats in Northern Virginia as Northam posted a strong showing in the populous region. The biggest battleground for the House was Prince William, a Washington exurb where people of color constitute a majority of the population. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), a culture warrior who opposes LGBT rights. Elizabeth Guzman, who raised more money than any Democratic candidate except for Hurst, unseated Del. L. Scott Lingamfelter (R-Woodbridge). Republican Dels. Richard L. Anderson (Prince William) and Jackson H. Miller (Manassas) lost to their Democratic challengers, Hala Ayala and Lee Carter. Ayala and Guzman are Latina, and Carter is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In an open seat vacated by a retiring Republican, Democrat Jennifer Carroll Foy easily defeated Republican Michael Makee. In Fairfax County, Democrat Kathy Tran, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, beat Republican Lolita Mancheno-Smoak for an open seat vacated by retiring Del. David B. Albo (R), while Democrat Karrie Delaney handily defeated Del. James M. LeMunyon (R). Del. Timothy D. Hugo, the Republican caucus chairman, was narrowly trailing Democratic challenger Donte Tanner, and the results were within the margin for a state-funded recount. Hugo picked up 100 votes during a Fairfax County canvass on Wednesday morning. Greason's fellow Loudoun County lawmaker, Del. J. Randall Minchew, lost his seat to Democratic challenger Wendy Gooditis. In the Richmond suburbs, Dels. John M. O'Bannon III and G. Manoli Loupassi lost their seats to Debra Rodman and Dawn Adams, who is openly lesbian. Democrat Schuyler T. VanValkenburg won an open seat vacated by Republican Jimmie Massie III. In the Virginia Beach area, Del. Del. Glenn R. Davis Jr. narrowly pulled out a win for reelection. Republicans were barely leading in three contests that were in the margin for a recount, including in the race to succeed retiring Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). Del. David Yancey (R-Newport News) led Shelly Simonds by only 12 votes. Even if Democrats fall short of taking control of the chamber this year, they see a potential for additional pickups next year, if a court challenge of legislative district maps forces special elections, and in 2019 when all 100 seats are on the ballot again. Republicans have a narrow 21-to-19 majority in the state Senate, where all seats are up in 2019. Control of the governor's mansion and legislature in Virginia has national implications. The General Assembly will draw congressional and state legislative district maps after the 2020 Census, and the governor has the power to veto those maps.
